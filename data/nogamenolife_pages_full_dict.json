It first aired in Japan on April 9, 2014 on most networks, and later on April 11, 2014 on BS11.<ref>http://ngnl.jp/onair/ ''Official Site''</ref>\n\n                ==Synopsis==\n                The episode begins with a stream of game messages, all making remarks about [[\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f]] and how about their own deaths. Following this proceeds a battle between [[Queen]]\u00a0and \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f's four characters as they furiously fight against each other. All the while, Queen questions their power and wonders how four players managed to defeat 1200. Using a hack to enable her to endlessly and repeatedly use overpowered spells, Queen bombards the \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f team, but it ends up being a failure as they dodge and defeat her. [[Dora|One unnamed gamer]] tells Queen that \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f may be using cheats and hacks (auto-aimers, auto-dodgers and hitbox manipulation)\u00a0in order to defeat anyone they fight online. The narrator notes \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f as an urban legend, recounting how they have managed to remain undefeated in more than 280 different games online.\n\n                {{Quote|Urban legends are a type of wish because in reality, the least interesting answer is usually the correct one.|Unseen Narrator}}\n\n                After the narrator states this, the scene shifts to [[Sora]]\u00a0and [[Shiro]], step-siblings, in their room where each of them had\u00a0controlled two of \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f's characters, Shiro controlling hers with her feet. When Sora asks Shiro why she was using her feet to control her characters, she replies with, \"I'm hungry.\" As Sora proceeds to start another game, Shiro feels tired due to having been up for five days straight, and hands over her mice to Sora to continue playing by himself as she starts to doze off. Soon, the pair receive an email from an unknown sender who asks them if they think they were born in the wrong world. When Sora clicks the link attached to the email, a chess game opens up and initially, Sora and Shiro assume it was a computer programmed chess match. However, Sora notices throughout the match that the moves being played did not seem to be those of a computer, and deduces that they might actually be playing against another person. Teaming up, the two of them resume the match against the unknown person. After what seemed like a very long time, they eventually defeat their challenger and are then sent another email by them, asking their opinion on their world; the siblings call life a \"crappy game.\" They are then asked how they would react if there was a world with clear goals and rules where everything was decided by simple games. Sora replies by saying, \"If there's a world like that, then we were born in the wrong world.\" After replying, all of their screens become distorted and static. They are then \"reborn\" into another world where the sender introduces himself as [[Tet]]\u00a0and welcomes them to his world, known as [[Disboard]],\u00a0and calls himself God. As Sora, Shiro and Tet fall, Tet explains to the siblings that everything is decided by games, including the lives of individuals as well as national borders. The world operates through [[Ten Pledges]] that Tet himself created when he became the One True God. While Tet explains the Ten Pledges, images are shown on screen of characters that appear in later episodes. As Tet finishes explaining the 9th Pledge, Sora and Shiro nearly crash into the ground but are stopped slightly above it and as a dazed Sora looks up, Tet explains the 10th Pledge and vanishes. Sora and Shiro then stand up, wondering where they are as a dragon soars up from underneath the cliff the two are standing on, and flies away. They respond by saying the game crashed.\n\n                Later on, the story of how Disboard came to be is explained to Sora and Shiro by [[Unnamed thieves|a group of men]] they had just defeated in a game. After his explaination, one of the men asks if they could at least have some fun, as they had most likely offered up their clothes as well. Sora recites Pledge 6 and walks off with Shiro as the two of them enter [[Elchea]], the capital city of [[Imanity]].\n\n                There is a gambling tournament to decide the next King, as written in the will of the last king. [[Stephanie Dola]] and [[Chlammy Zell]]\u00a0are seen having a poker game. An unnamed woman explains to Sora and Shiro about the tournament, and informs them that Stephanie is the grand-daughter of the [[Former king of Imanity|last king]] and how she has entered the tournament in order to become the next king. Sora asks the woman if she is willing to enter the tournament. She replies by saying that the money she has is enough and Sora then taunts her into a game of poker in which the woman would wager her money while Sora and Shiro would offer their lives. The two swear by the Pledges\u00a0and begin their game as Sora recounts to the woman about their day. The woman ends up playing a\u00a0Fullhouse while Sora ends up playing a Royal Straight Flush, beating the woman and earning her gold. As she asks who they are, Sora replies by saying that he is an outsider. After they walk away, Shiro tells Sora he cheated, but Sora recites Pledge 8 and tells her that since they weren't caught, it doesn't matter. Sora negotiates with the [[inn-keeper]] and ends up staying for four nights with just one gold coin. The inn-keeper asks for a name, and Sora replies by saying to keep it blank.\n\n                As Sora and Shiro walk off, they notice that Chlammy is cheating, but are unsure how. Sora whispers in Stephanie's ear that Chlammy was cheating and the siblings head up to their room. The two group what they still have from their old world and Sora is relieved that they still have that much. Sora notes that when a protagonist enters another world, they would usually try to make it back home, and Sora questions why. The episode ends with Stephanie coming up to their room and asking whether she has permission to enter.\n\n                ==Major events==\n                *[[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] defeat [[Tet]], the God of the world of [[Disboard]].\n                *[[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] are transported to the world of [[Disboard]] by [[Tet]].\n                *[[Tet]] teaches [[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] the [[Ten Pledges]].\n\n                ==Characters==\n                The following characters are listed by the order which they appear in.\n                ===Major characters===\n                *[[Sora]]\n                *[[Shiro]]\n                *[[Tet]]\n                *[[Stephanie Dola]]\n                *[[Chlammy Zell]]\n\n                ===Minor characters===\n                ;Speaking roles\n                *[[Queen]]\n                *[[dora]]\n                *[[Three unnamed thieves]]\n                *Unnamed female gambler\n                *[[Inn-keeper]]\n                ;Non-speaking roles\n                *Members of \u300e[[Night Opera]]\u300f\n                *[[Jibril]]\n                *[[Fiel Nirvalen]]\n                *[[Miko]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Ino]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Izuna]]\n\n                ==Games==\n                {{Game Infobox\n                |name=\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300fVS \u300eNight Opera\u300f - Untitled Video Game\n                |challengerplayers=[[Sora]]\n                |challengerwager=N/A\n                |challengedplayers=[[Queen]]<br/>[[dora]]<br/>1198 other players\n                |challengedwager=N/A\n                |challengerresult=Win\n                |challengedresult=Lose\n                |notes=\n                *As this game did not take place in [[Disboard]], no wager was set.\n                *As this game started off-screen, it is unclear who the challenger was.\n                }}\n                {{Game Infobox\n                |name=Tet VS \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f - Chess\n                |challengerplayers=[[Tet]]\n                |challengerwager=N/A\n                |challengedplayers=[[Sora]]<br/>[[Shiro]]\n                |challengedwager=N/A\n                |challengerresult=Lose\n                |challengedresult=Win\n                |notes=\n                *As this game did not take place in [[Disboard]], no wager was set.\n                }}\n                {{Game Infobox\n                |name=\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f VS Thieves - Unknown Game\n                |challengerplayers=[[Sora]]<br/>[[Shiro]]\n                |challengerwager=Unknown\n                |challengedplayers=[[Three unnamed thieves]]\n                |challengedwager=Direction to nearest street.

This was due to her belief that humans will never be strong enough and must depend on others in order to survive. She is the friend of the elven girl [[Fiel Nirvalen]], despite being a slave of Fiel's family.\n\n                After [[Sora]] bet the [[Race Piece]] of [[Imanity]] in their game with the [[Eastern Union]], Chlammy Zell challenged Sora in an attempt to win the Race Piece. However, Sora, as he was challenged and thus had the right to choose the game, chose a game in which they would both bet everything they have in parts, tricked her into sharing his memories with her. After Sora won the game, he returned all memories to the respective owners. After Chlammy had seen Sora's memory's, she decided to go along with him and his plan.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                Chlammy Zell is a rather short girl with black hair and most of the time, wears a black veil draped over her head. She holds a non-emotional expression prior to her defeat by Sora and [[Shiro]]. She seems to have a slight breast size complex as revealed in Episode 10.\n\n                ==Personality==\n                When Sora yelled at her for underestimating the human race, she threw away her confident facade and broke down in tears while childishly calling Sora names and blaming him. When she challenged Sora again, she still acted pessimistic about the possibilities of the Imanity, but after being defeated again and having her memories restored, she gained a newly found respect for Sora and the Imanity, and they parted ways in good terms as she agreed to help defeat the [[Werebeast]]s and unite the other races.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n                She co-ordinates well with her friend, Fiel, allowing her to sneak elf [[magic]] into games intricately enough that it can be difficult to detect the source, even for those capable of sensing magic (as in the case in Vol 5 Prologue against Barter).\n\n                ==Weakness==\n                She greatly underestimated Imanity, thus also underestimating her own abilities. Since her encounter with Sora, however, she learned to have more faith in the wisdom of humanity. Although she may still believe Imanity is at a disadvantage to the other races, she learned that Imanity can cope with it through other methods and has since been studying ways to overcome Elven magic despite Imanity being unable to even detect it much less use it.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                [[pl:Kurami Zell]]\n                [[es:Clammy Zell]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Female]]\n                [[Category:Imanity]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]",

He asked them to give him their Soul Essence to avoid said starvation. Jibril informs them that 'many bodily fluids contain varying amounts of soul essence'. Shiro helps him with the order for him to lick Shiro's foot to consume her sweat. Plum states that he likes the taste of Shiro's sweat. Jibril says it's because Shiro has a tough, strong, extremely rare, unique and noble soul that any common person who searches the entire world for such a presence will still never meet. After being saved by Shiro,\u00a0Plum asked them to help his race.\n\n                He is the last male [[Dhampir]] who lived in [[Oceando]] with the [[Seiren]]s and asked [[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] for help with saving his species from extinction.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                Plum wears gothic clothing and a small top hat. He has blue hair and a black set of wings. He has also gotten a devilish looking tail.\n\n                Although initially believed to be a girl due to how he dresses, he eventually reveals that he is a boy and the last male Dhampir who dressed like a girl to hide his actual gender.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                He seems to be timid and easily prone to crying, but he is easily motivated at the prospect of obtaining fluids from Sora and Shiro due to their different attributions as they came from another world.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Like other Dhampires, he's very good at altering the perception of others with [[magic]]. He's also capable of creating a love potion so strong that it could pass as real love, something that neither [[Elves]] nor [[Flugel]]s have been capable of despite their magical prowess over the other life form races of the Exceed. He is also good at shapeshifting, as he transformed into a scarf that gave Sora and Shiro the capability to fly during their game against the Fl\u00fcgel. This transformation has its own merits, as mostly Elves are the only ones who can use more than two spells at the same time.\n\n                He was able to fool a Flugel and a [[Phantasma]] using his Deception Spell after consuming a very little amount of blood from Sora. He even brags that at his maximum capacities, he could even fool an [[Old Deus]] (although he could have been exaggerating).\n\n                He proved himself a very capable strategist, having fooled even Sora and Shiro in his true gender for awhile. He was able to manipulate the events of [[Volume 4]] & [[Volume 5|5]] into a win-win situation where if Sora and Shiro beat [[Laira]]'s game, the Dhampirs thereby are able to feed on [[Imanity]] who now shoulder the responsibilities of the Seirens. If Sora and Shiro lost, then Plum would simply state that it was an offering of food for the Seirens and could possibly allow the Dhampirs to feed as well.\n\n                ==Weakness==\n\n                Like all Dhampirs, Plum will die when exposed to the sun's rays. He can combat this by utilizing magic to block out the sun's rays. However, it takes a large amount of energy to maintain and thus is better for him to use it while in a dark area (a wooden box for the case of going to the beach with the main characters in volume 4) to lessen the amount of energy required to maintain the spell.\n\n                Ever since tasting Shiro's sweat, Plum has had a taste for the siblings' soul essence to the point of it being somewhat of an addiction. As such, the siblings often used it as a means of bargaining with Plum to aid them on their journey.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                TBE\n\n                ==Images==\n                <gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\">\n                NGNL4 022.jpg\n                NGNL5 350.jpg\n                NGNL5 003.jpg\n                NGNL5 208.jpg\n                P284-285.jpg\n                Kuchie-002.jpg\n                </gallery>\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Dhampir]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Pages to improve on]]\n                [[Category:Male]]",

Their homeland is\u00a0[[Avant Heim]], a floating city in the sky. The kanji for their name can be read as angels, but [[Sora]] noted that they are more alike to demons, as they hold powers of mass-destruction and massacred countless beings during the ancient war. The race is governed by the Council of Eighteen Wings consisting of 9 Flugels that rule in an oligarchical fashion. In emergency situations, [[Azriel]], the Representative of the Winged, puts forth the decisions.\n\n                Fl\u00fcgels are ancient warriors created by the [[Old Deus]] [[Artosh]] to fight their wars for them. While their combat abilities are sealed by the\u00a0[[Ten Oaths]], they still retain immortality as well as high [[magic]] ability. Due to their nature, Fl\u00fcgels tends to have violent thoughts and are condescending towards other races below them. After the declaration of the Ten Oaths, the Fl\u00fcgels began collecting knowledge all over\u00a0[[Disboard]]\u00a0by robbing the other races of their books and as Disboard is a world without printing technology, these robbed books were not easy to replace. When their homeland became stacked with books, the Fl\u00fcgels passed a law to share the books among themselves.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                As the Fl\u00fcgels were created to kill gods, their very body can easily break physical limitation. Using their magical skills, they can teleport into anywhere they can see, or where they have visited. Also, their strongest attack, 'Heavenstrike', is formed by using all [[Elemental|Elementals]] nearby, and powerful enough to destroy [[Elven Gard|Elven Gard's]] magical barrier which was formed by 3000 elven magicians, and even damage to city itself. However, it seems to exhaust one's power for years after its fully charged attack. In [[Volume 4]], [[Jibril]] literally 'splits' the sea apart with only 5% power Airstrike and in the dating sim is able to continuously flatten the [[Seiren]] city while it regenerated.\n\n                Fl\u00fcgels have no sense of shame, as was shown when Sora used magic in the game against the Fl\u00fcgels. He made a group of them naked, but they continued to chase Sora and [[Shiro]] without any hesitation. They only stopped after Sora used a magic that made them grope each other.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Sora and Shiro are able to beat the Fl\u00fcgel in a physical flying game of tag in [[Volume 5]] by abusing their lack of information on aerobatic maneuvers, although they later adapt. In both games against Fl\u00fcgel (word materialisation and Flying Tag) Sora and Shiro are able to abuse their lack of scientific understanding to win.\n\n                After using airstrike or godstrike, the Fl\u00fcgel are left in weakened states, much younger and in some cases unable to even move.\n\n                ==History==\n                The Fl\u00fcgel were created by Artosh during the Great War to act as God killers, to kill other Old Deus. The first and weakest Fl\u00fcgel is Azriel whilst the final and most powerful was Jibril. During the Great war Artosh uses all his and the Fl\u00fcgels strength to release Divine Strike. This does massive damage, but exposes himself and leaves the majority of the Fl\u00fcgel unable to fight back waves of [[Ex-machina]], which come and peel off his essence. This severely weakens him and ensures the Star Grail did not materialise to him. This allows Tet to spawn from [[Riku|Riku's]] imagination and prayers and take the Star Grail, making him the most powerful Old Deus. \n\n                Artosh dies, and [[Tet]] reforms the entire world with the 10 pledges. This means that the Fl\u00fcgels, a race designed to destroy, had no place left in Disboard. The Fl\u00fcgel were left without purpose. Instead they dedicated themselves to obtaining knowledge in accordance to Artosh's words; \u201cI can\u2019t understand it, because only the weak are able to. It\u2019s the unknown possibility that I may lose to one stronger than I.\u201d. Artosh's loss is credited to his lack of understanding so the Fl\u00fcgel seek to understand all.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *Fl\u00fcgel means ''wing''\u00a0or ''wings'' in German\n\n                *Being weapons of war, the Fl\u00fcgels are believed to not possess the emotion of love (or rather not truly able to grasp its meaning). They do seem to have the rest of the wide range of emotions.\n\n                *The Fl\u00fcgels are known to have collected the skulls of their slain enemies. Although they now mainly collect books due to the implementation of the Ten Oaths, the skulls are still displayed within their homes, as noted by the skulls in Jibril's library.\n                *All the Fl\u00fcgels may have names ending with the \"eel\" sound, considering Jibril and Azriel do and a random Fl\u00fcgel in Book 6 is named Raphael. It is a reference to angelic names across Abrahamic religions (such as Islam and Judaism), note that Jibril, or Gabriel, Azriel and Raphael are angel's names.\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n\n                [[pl:Uskrzydleni]]\n                [[es:\u00c1ngeles]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",

They appear to be a race of cybernetic life forms that appear in [[volume 6]], not much is currently known about them. The only known Ex-machina is [[Shuvi]].\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Due to their nature of living in clusters and sharing a linked mind, as well as their AI-like nature, they have superior calculation abilities and communication usually takes no more than 3 seconds. It is said that they are able to replicate any attack launched at them in less than 10 seconds after seeing it. In addition to being able to replicate [[Azriel|Azriel's]] Heavenly Shift near instantly despite their losses; they were even able to reflect an attack from [[Artosh]].\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Although they are able to replicate and counteract attacks from opponents with ferocity, they are a defensive race in nature. If not provoked, they have no aggression towards the person or group. Therefore, they could potentially lose if they are beaten by the first move or if an unpredictable method they have not seen before is used before they can fully assess and correct the situation. It's also notable that something such as Artosh's \"Divine Strike\" was considered unable to be calculated due to its sheer power, so one can speculate that, while able to reproduce a [[Fl\u00fcgel|Fl\u00fcgel's]] power, they can't match that of an Old Deus.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                During the Great War, they were created by an [[Old Deus]] to kill the other Gods.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *The Ex-machina are considered to be the only race other than the Fl\u00fcgel to kill an Old Deus during the Great War\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n                [[es:Ex Machina]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",

The current representative of the Seirens is their empress [[Laira]] who was in a self-induced cold sleep for around 800 years until woken up recently by [[Sora]]. Their capital city is [[Oceando]] but it is unknown whether this is their only city or if they have settlements expanding into other parts of the ocean.\n\n                The Seirens are considered to be stupid by most races; according to [[Plum]] and [[Jibril]], Seirens only know how to play and mate and are very carefree, even at the prospect of their race going extinct. Complying to the ranking of the exceed, they don't excel in any particular [[magic]] other than Seduction Magic as their bodies are filled with Water [[Elemental|Elementals]] that can attract the Elementals in the bodies of the other races.\n\n\n                == Strengths ==\n\n                Although unable to control magic, Seirens do have the ability to control the water elementals within their bodies. This allows them to generate an attractive force between the water elementals of their bodies with the elementals in other life forms, similar in effect to seduction magic. This control also allows them to enter a cold sleep, in which they are able to sleep for centuries on end.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                The Seirens race are believed by the other races to be the most stupid race of the Exceed. However, it is possible it could all be a ploy as Laira's game was revealed to be an elaborate trap that even accounted for Plum's betrayal.\n\n                Due to the large amount of water elementals within their bodies, the Seirens can only survive while in water. This has thereby isolated the Seirens from the rest of the races as Seirens can only be found in the ocean where their capitol city, Oceando, is located. As such, diplomacy or even contact with a Seiren would be considered rare which compounds their reproductive crisis when the [[Ten Pledges]] were implemented. However, this isolation resulted in the development of a self-sustaining society using marine resources to allow the Seirens to survive without the need for trade with the other races to acquire any remaining necessary resources.\u00a0\n\n                Their race is comprised solely of females with one empress acting as the primary source of children for their race (for political reasons), although all Seiren are capable of reproducing with males from any race. This means that they need to abduct males that are close to the shores or on boats in order for the race to survive to the next generation. The fact that Seirens have long life spans helps diminish the urgency for reproduction. However, due to the implementation of the Ten Pledges, the Seirens would have to gamble in order to obtain males for reproduction, a very unfavorable situation considering each game would require the male to bet his own life and the Seiren most likely betting her life. This might have resulted in the Seirens slowly dying off had it not been for the intervention of the Dhampirs.\n\n                Due to their cooperative relationship with the [[Dhampir]], several Seirens are probably infected with the light lethality disease transmitted to them by the bite of a Dhampir. Whether or not the Seirens designate a select few to have their blood sucked or a certain age limit is implemented is uncertain but the young Seirens are most likely devoid of the disease. Luckily, due to Oceando being at the bottom of the ocean where no sunlight can reach, the Seiren population as a whole is mostly unaffected by this disease.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                The Seirens, before the enactment of the Ten Pledges, would abduct males from any race and forcefully reproduce with them by consuming their blood and soul essence. Due to the large amount of soul essence required, the male usually dies in the process. However, now with the Ten Pledges in place, their days were numbered due to the increasing difficulty to acquire mates.\n\n                Some time after the Ten Pledges were implemented, the Dhampir approached them with a game for mutual cooperation. The Dhampir wagered their help in providing the Seirens with mates (either their race or another's) while the Seirens wagered to provide the Dhampirs their blood. Although a draw would have been favorable for both races, the Seirens won the game.\n\n                They are currently living in mutualistic dominance over the Dhampir in Oceando after the Seirens won the game for mutualistic benefits with the seirens betting that the males of the Dhampir will sustain the seirens for reproduction purposes and the dhampir betting for access to feeding on the seirens as the seirens mainly live under water and so are not affected by direct sunlight and so are mainly not affected by the vampiric disease.\n\n                Approximately 800 years before Sora and [[Shiro]] arrived to [[Disboard]], the then princess of the Seirens, Laira, read a fairy tale about a princess who has everything, much like herself, and an assassin who offered her something she did not have.

He was one of the main protagonists in [[Tet]]'s story. He encountered [[Shuvi]] while going on an expedition and brought her to his colony after having lost in a game against her (albeit willingly, as he judged that winning was impossible, so instead he changed the bets to his favor).\n\n\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                He bears many similarities with [[Sora]], being his hairstyle, slender body, black eyes and his face.\u00a0\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                Ever since his home was destroyed and he took over as leader of his colony, he's had a somewhat split personality. When the figurative lock on his [heart] is locked, he appears emotionless, cold, and calculating. When his heart is unlocked, the emotions he bottled up are released (often violently). His endeavors with Shuvi has since lessened his split personality and he appears to be more open around her.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Riku is a master strategist and manipulator, much like Sora. He is capable of duping even the matriarch of the Nilvalen family (known as the strongest and smartest Elf at the time) into giving out valuable information, albeit at the cost of his health. Through his efforts and skillful leadership, the [Ghosts] were able to manipulate all the races into forming alliances with each other and drastically change the tide of the Great War, all while standing in the sidelines.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                As a 'human' (as they were yet to be baptized or renamed as 'Imanity' by Tet at that time), his body was weak especially when compared to other those from other clans. like other humans, the elemental bones corrode or eat up his skin and organs when they come in contact.<blockquote>He, along with the other [Ghosts] had mutilated bodies(burned skin that never healed, amputated limbs, and damaged organs) since they applied elemental bones on themselves to hide their identities from the other clans, as elemental bones 'disrupt' magic, preventing identification through senses or the use of magic.</blockquote>\n\n                == Death ==\n                After obtaining the Star Grail, he started to succumb to his wounds, and his remaining arm(his right arm) disappeared as he was reaching for it. Deeming himself unworthy/too weak, he starts to call out to the God of Games, or to anyone who would put an end to the war, eventually, Tet shows up and claims the Star Grail, proclaiming, as Riku disintegrated, that one day, they will play another game.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *His name 'Riku' means earth or land in Japanese, in contrast to Sora's name which means sky.\n                *It is implied that Riku is the first ever living being on the world of Disboard to create the concept of 'cheating without getting caught'. He is also the one responsible for the allocation of the 16 Race Pieces.\n                * He was still a virgin until his death at the end of the [[The Great War]], as he said himself.\n\n                * It is implied that he played a game with Tet when he was a boy.\n\n                ==<nowiki/>==\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Male]]\n                [[Category:Imanity]]",

Her offer was to return to [[Avant Heim]] and conquer the entire [[Flugel]] race to offer as her bet, but Sora noted that since it would take a few hundred years, Jibril's everything would be enough as the bet.\n                ==Trivia==\n                *The episode title's katakana has a different meaning from its kanji. The katakana (\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ec\u30b9\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0) reads 'interesting', while the kanji (\u4e00\u624b) can be read literally as 'one hand' but has a figurative meaning of 'one (game) move'.\n                *'Interesting' in chess terms in Japanese refers to an unexpected move.\n                *The tablet which Jibril drooled on greatly resembles an iPad.\n                *The first term used by Jibril in this episode's Shiritori, {{nihongo|Ku-ri anse (Number four ninth protection spell)|\u30af\u30fc\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30bb \u3010\u4e5d\u9060\u7b2c\u56db\u52a0\u8b77\u3011}}, was slightly misspelled.

It first aired in Japan on June 4, 2014 on AT-X, and later on June 6, 2014 on other networks.\n\n                ==Plot summary==\n                In an attempt to remember her brother, [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Shiro Shiro] frantically searches the castle to find [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Sora Sora]. To her dismay, she is unable to find Sora, and begin to doubt he even exists. [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Stephanie_Dola Steph] and [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Jibril Jibril] are unable to recall whom Sora even is, and are unable to help Shiro in her search. Believing Sora is truly a fathom of Shiro's imagination, Jibril challenges Shiro to a game of chess, where the wager is Shiro's memories of Sora. Jibril asks Shiro to lose this game on purpose, so that she can put her mind at ease about Sora.\n\n                As Shiro is about to lose against Jibril, she detects a faint feeling from Sora. This inspires Shiro to win the match, instead of throwing the match against Jibril. To prove that Sora exists, Shiro asks Steph and Jibril to recall the previous few days, in which all both are unable to do.\u00a0 After asking Jibril to use her ability to detect [[magic]] in the area where she was found sleeping, Shiro beings to piece things together. Steph trips in the room, and Shiro notices three unused Othello pieces. Shiro then remembers why she and the others were unable to remember Sora.\n\n                In the previous two days, Sora had entered into a battle of against [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Chlammy_Zell Chlammy Zell], in a special game of Othello, modified by the magic of [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Feel_Nilvalen Feel Nilvalen]. The wager for winning the game was the ability to gain two demands from the opposing player. In this game of Othello, memories would be robbed from the current losing player, and given to the current winning player. However, the lost of memories would also weaken the player themselves, and potentially kill the other player, if too many of their memories were lost. For this reason, Sora asks that if such a thing would happen, another friend of the player would be able to step in and play for them. Sora purposely began to lose his memories, so that Chlammy would believe him in the fact that he was not in alliance with any other nation (during their previous game for the rights to be king), and furthermore, reveal his plans to Chlammy to take over the [http://no-game-no-life.wikia.com/wiki/Eastern_Union Eastern Union]. In the process, he began to lose himself, and depended on Shiro to finish his game of Othello. Shiro finishes and wins the game of Othello for Sora, thus revealing all characters in the room.\n\n                Upon recovering consciousness, Sora then begins tell his two demands for winning the game. First, he demands that each keeps a copy of the memories they stole from one another, while keeping their own original memories. Second, he demands the ability to alter Fiel's memories.\n\n                ==Characters==\n                The following\u00a0characters are listed by the order which they appear in.\n\n                ===Major characters===\n                *[[Shiro]]\n                *[[Sora]]\n                *[[Stephanie Dola]]\n                *[[Jibril]]\n                *[[Chlammy Zell]]\n                *[[Fiel Nirvalen]]\n\n                ===Minor characters===\n                ;Non-speaking roles\n                *Shiro's Mother\n                *Sora's Father\n                *[[Hatsuse Izuna]]\n\n                ==Events==\n                *Flashback of Shiro's memory from age 0-3\n                *Shiro goes mad from Sora's disappearance\n                *Stephanie and Jibril believe Shiro had false memories inserted by Izuna\n                *Jibril plays chess with Shiro, hoping to erase her supposedly false memories\n                *The girls raised the possibility that Sora does actually exist and that there was a game still ongoing\n                *Flashback of how the game was set up\n                *Shiro winning the game and reuniting with Sora\n                *Sora issued his two requests to Chlammy and Fiel\n\n                ==Key differences from light novel==\n                In the light novel,\n                *There was further discussion about the limitations of the [[Ten Pledges]] where each character was asked to 'become' another character after losing a game.

Having gone through a rough childhood, he has a lackadaisical hate towards life and is pretty much dedicated only to gaming. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world after they defeated [[Tet]] in chess. Sora's biological father (no relation to Shiro) married Shiro's biological mother (no relation to Sora), thus making Shiro and Sora only step-siblings.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                Sora is a tall and lean young man with smooth fair skin, spiky red hair in the light novel (maroon in the anime). He has red eyes with dark bags under them which are probably due to excessive gaming with no signs of rest (sleep deprivation) and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. He was also seen in the old King's clothing and his yellow shirt which has the text \"I (heart) humanity\" in Kanji, along with a blue undershirt with a red hand band and sneakers. He wears his crown on his left arm.\n\n                ==Personality==\n                Despite being a NEET and shut-in, Sora is extremely outgoing, confident, with endless vitality and virility, not afraid to play with people face to face, even when they are cheating. He's extremely manipulative, which he calls \"negotiation and diplomacy skill.\" This complements the playing style of Shiro consisting of logic and calculations, while his consist of emotions, observations, deductions, behavior, language, tactics and human logic. He can be extremely arrogant and speak in a condescending manner with those he plays against, especially AFTER discovering a winning method.\n\n                However, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door, he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck and only returns to his former self if he is able to see or hear her. He views his sister as his equal and partner and even looks up to her, but is also protective of her, such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard ground when first arriving in the world of [[Disboard]].\n\n                Shown usually calm when playing games, he can sometimes be very nervous when not knowing what to do. This is depicted when he is battling [[Chlammy]]\u00a0when he displays a calm personality but is in fact, panicking. When Shiro holds his hand he regains his confidence. He also seems to be a bit of a misanthrope as he claims humans are stupid, lowly creatures, including himself. However, he believes the potential of humanity because the proof of it he thinks, is Shiro, a person who has hope and fantasies. He also believes that living in the world that he was born in was a mistake, that he was supposed to be born in another world, with his sister Shiro.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                [[File:Seduces queen.png|thumb|250px|right]]Despite being a shut-in, Sora has incredible superhuman charisma and eloquence. He is an excellent and natural speaker, always knows exactly what to say to get others on his side. He has no problems dealing with people.\n\n                While not as intelligent as Shiro in calculations, he is shown to have a brilliant super-genius IQ and an eidetic memory which enables him to quickly learn, understand, and easily recall limitless amounts of information perfectly and rapidly. This is demonstrated during his card game with Steph.\u00a0Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can quickly determine what his opponents are going to do based on observation of their behavior and motivations, a technique called \"cold reading.\" His amazing observational and deductive skills help him come up with complex plans quickly and easily. This is shown during his game against Jibril and when he figured out the previous King's plan to beat the [[Werebeast]]. He was even able to learn to read [[Imanity-go]] in just about one hour slower than his sister (self-proclaimed).\n\n                He is also highly manipulative (convincing an [[Inn-keeper]] to let them stay four nights) despite not lying to others (although he does tell half truths) and good at war and romance games. His superhuman charisma, eloquence, intelligence, memory, tactical/inventive skills, and his ability to rule, allowed him to quickly fix all of Elchea's problems from economics to agriculture within a few weeks of being crowned King.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                While brilliant, Sora is not as intelligent as his sister when it comes to calculated based games and through his own admission can not play games such as high level chess effectively. Despite being a shut-in, he is slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself, with his lust leading to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and elicits a scolding from Shiro. He also has trouble with crowds but can handle them when he is with his sister.\n\n                His most significant weakness is his reliance on Shiro. If he is separated from her by so much as a door, he becomes a quivering, spineless coward. During episode 11, he was able to overcome this completely as they were holding hands in the real world while in their game pods.\n\n                ==Character==\n\n                Sora is 18 years old. He later becomes king after winning a game and therefore his sister becomes queen.\n\n                He lives with his step-sister Shiro and was abandoned by his parents at a young age. After that, Sora pledged to be there for his sister no matter what.\n\n                Sora cares about his step-sister Shiro very much. He has an absolute trust in her which can be shown in anime episode 9 or volume 3 chapter 1 where two things more important than himself were his trust in Shiro and everything about her. Similar to his sister he has a sibling-complex, being with her at all time and panicking if they're not in the same room together. Although this doesn't keep him from hitting on other girls (mostly [[Stephanie Dola]]). He has also shown to have perverted tendencies.\n\n                ==Background==\n\n                In the light novel, Sora's family isn't being explained well. But there are parts from Shiro's point of view which tell about their parents. Sora and Shiro are step-siblings, which means Sora's father married Shiro's mother. After the wedding, his family lived together, and that's when he met Shiro. When she saw Sora for the first time, Shiro mumbled \".....Really......how empty......,\" as Sora was smiling when people smiled ; A smile that contained nothingness and lacked expression. Shocked at hearing that comment,\u00a0as if he found something big, Sora smiled and asked her to play game with him. That day, they played 20 games in a row.\n\n                As time elapsed, the siblings began to live together. Sora mentioned that \"those that were called their parents were no longer present,\" implying that their parents abandoned them. He mouthed out such words to his little sister in reply, \"Meh, from now on, it's just you and me then.\" From that point onwards, with their names joined together, they started to play online games. Conjoining the two names: Sora (Sky or Empty) and Shiro (White), [[\u300e \u300f]]was created. One after another, he kept coming up with strange, adaptable strategies that even his step-sister herself could not imagine. But then, the precise and accurate deductions that Shiro calculated out had far exceeded the expectations of Sora. At that time, the siblings started to play games as a Two in One. With an unbroken streak of victories, the two of them even came to be regarded as an urban legend on the Internet.\n\n                When they defeated the self-proclaimed One True God on Internet chess, they were thrown into another world. This was a world where everything was determined by games, restrained by a force known as the [[Ten Oaths]]\u2014\u2014 the world called Disboard .\n\n                In V3C1P6 of the light novel, after Chlammy\u00a0is defeated by Sora and gains his memories, she exclaimed \"How can you remain sane after all [These Experiences]!?\" suggesting that he had suffered greatly during his childhood. (It is interesting to note that the author wrote that it was something that even Shiro was not aware about)\n\n                ==Quotes==\n                {{Quote|\"People will only truly fight for what is right.

Later on, they are approached by [[Tet]], who confirms that they may play against him for the title of \"One True God\", should they be able to conquer all the other [[Exceed]] in the world and thus obtain all the chesspieces needed for the challenging game. They accept his challenge with a smile.\n\n                ==Characters==\n                The following\u00a0characters are listed by the order which they appear in.\n                ===Major characters===\n                * [[Chlammy Zell]]\n                * [[Sora]]\n                * [[Stephanie Dola]]\n                * [[Shiro]]\n                * [[Tet]]\n                ===Minor characters===\n                ;Speaking roles\n                * [[Former king of Imanity]]\u00a0(flashback)\n                *[[Elderly official]]\n                * Minister of Agriculture\n                * Minister of Economy\n                * [[Hatsuse Ino]]\n\n                ;Non-speaking roles\n                * [[Fiel Nirvalen]]\n                * [[Hatsuse Izuna]]\n                * [[Miko]]\n                * [[Jibril]]\n                * [[Inn-keeper]]\n                * [[Three unnamed thieves]]\n\n                ==Events==\n                ''For games, the challenger is listed before the challenged party.''\n                *Conclusion of the match of chess between the siblings and Chlammy Zell\n                **'''Result:''' The siblings win\n                *Coronation of the siblings (interrupted several times by Sora and Shiro due to the misunderstanding that there could only be one king/queen)\n                *3-day-long match of normal '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_maid_(card_game) Old maid]' between the siblings\n                **'''Result:''' Tie\n                *Compulsory rock-paper-scissors match between Sora and the Imanity ministers, where Sora plays scissors and all ministers are forced to play paper\n                *Coronation speech by the siblings to the Imanity, in which Sora declares war against all other races\n\n                ==Key differences from light novel==\n                In the light novel,\n                *The [[Race Piece]] did not magically appear in the sky during the siblings' coronation speech.\n                *Tet did not appear out of no where to speak to the siblings, nor did he teleport them to the roof.

It first aired in Japan on May 28, 2014 on AT-X, and later on May 30, 2014 on other networks.\n\n                ==Plot summary==\n                [[Sora]], [[Shiro]], [[Jibril]] and [[Steph]] arrive at the [[Embassy of Elchea]] to challenge the [[Werebeast]]s to a game. There, they meet\u00a0[[Hatsuse Ino|Ino]] and [[Izuna]]. Sora and Shiro later reveal that the Werebeasts cannot read minds, but can only tell if someone is lying or not. They also reveal that the reasons the Werebeasts could win at every single game were because they challenged the other races to a video game. As the other races could not remember what game they played or why they lost, they had no chance of winning. Sora and Shiro then bet the [[Race Piece]] of [[Imanity]], meaning the fate of all Imanity\u00a0was put at stake in this game.\n\n                ==Characters==\n                The following\u00a0characters are listed by the order which they appear in.\n\n                ===Major characters===\n                *[[Shiro]]\n                *[[Sora]]\n                *[[Jibril]]\n                *[[Stephanie Dola]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Ino]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Izuna]]\n                *[[Chlammy Zell]]\n                *[[Fiel Nirvalen]]\n\n                ===Minor characters===\n                ;Non-speaking roles\n                *Unnamed werebeasts\n\n                ==Events==\n                *Sora, Shiro, Jibril and Steph arrive at the Embassy of Elchea and are greeted by Hatsuse Ino\n                *The siblings prove that the Werebeasts sixth sense is a scam\n                *The siblings bet Imanity's race piece to challenge the Werebeasts for 'everything on the [[Eastern Union]]'\n                *Riots by the citizens of [[Elchea]]\n                *Sora's existence is erased\n\n                ==Key differences from light novel==\n                In the light novel,\n                *Jibril's interest was not piqued by the television, although she did ask Sora what it was. And as opposed to anime, this is not taken into factor of consideration when they deduce Werebeasts' game.\n                *Steph rebutted to Ino that they had sent letters following the proper procedure to arrange a meeting with the Werebeasts. This shocked and embarrassed Ino, as he was unaware that the letters were intercepted by others. Ino later found and punished the culprit who hid the letters. This segment was skipped over in the anime.\n                *Shiro adds 100 points to Izuna for being moe, but in the anime, she adds 1050 points instead.\n                *It was never explained what would happen if a race were to lose its race piece, only vaguely stating that it would be the 'end of Imanity'. In the anime, it is explained by [[Fiel Nirvalen]] that this is the first time a race had bet its race piece, and that the [[Ten Oaths]] would no longer apply to that race, if the race piece were to be lost, making them no different from animals (meaning a ''de facto'' death sentence for that race). Also, a glowing blue symbol of the [[Race Piece]] appears on every Imanity's left breast (where the heart is) when the race piece is bet. The symbol continues to glow faintly, and stops glowing the next day, leaving a brown birthmark of the same symbol.\n                *The game that the siblings were playing on their PSP was never mentioned. In the anime, they were playing Othello, which is a foreshadowing of the game in the next episode.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                * This is the first episode in which the episode title does not follow the titles of the main chapter in the light novels. Instead, it is named after the epilogue of [[Volume 2]].

She lost her real name during the formation of the country when placing it as a wager. Thus her current namesake is usually written in brackets. She looked down on [[Imanity]] at first, but after forming a truce with [[Sora]] and joining the [[Elchea Federation]], she starts to have faith in the siblings who represent Imanity. She also ordered [[Izuna]] and [[Hatsuse Ino|Ino]] to follow Sora and [[Shiro]], believing that both can learn more from the siblings.\n\n                Miko is voiced by [[wikipedia:Naomi Shindo|Naomi Shindo]] in the anime. She is shown in flashes during the [[This game|opening song]] and episodes [[Episode 01|1]] and [[:File:Miko close up.png|4]] but made her official appearance in [[episode 12]]\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                She usually has a smile on her face in many situations, showing her confidence and knowledge. She is also very affectionate towards her people as she told Sora to take care of the Werebeasts if she would lose the coin toss. She, as many other races, used to look down on Imanity. However, after the alliance with Sora, she begins to respect them, mainly the siblings. Her respect and trust for Sora increases on hearing Sora 's intentions to save Ino, compared to her's which would be sacrificing Ino to get the two races in [[volume 4]].\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                She has long golden hair, fox ears, and two golden tails. She typically wears a kimono and a monocle.\n\n                Sora had hypothesized Miko's age to be at least 58 years old, but her true age remains unknown. Despite her true age, Miko holds the appearance of a woman in her 20's.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                Miko had to spend at least 50 years to unite the various Werebeast tribes into what is currently the Eastern Union. As the leader of the Werebeasts, she was responsible for the expansion of the Eastern Union and thus played games against the Imanity (8 times), the [[Elf|elves]] (4 times), the [[Fl\u00fcgel]] (1 time), although it is unknown whether she played the games herself or sent a representative in her stead. The Werebeasts were once known for never challenging other races in games, but always being victorious when challenged.\n\n                Later, after [[Kuhaku|the siblings]] had won over all the lands the Werebeast claimed on the continent, Miko challenges them to a game match, which was decided as a coin flip. Circumstances made a tie favorable to simply winning the coin flip, and thus the Eastern Union formed an alliance under [[Elchea]] and named it the [[Elchea Federation]].\n\n                As of book 7, her life is used as part of the bet in the dice game against the Old Deus.\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Female]]\n                [[Category:Werebeast]]\n                [[Category:Pages to improve on]]",

Imanity is ranked as the 16th race of the [[Exceed]] due to their affanity to [[magic]] being 0, whether it's sensing or using it. The current representatives of Imanity are Sora and Shiro while the representative prior to them was the [[Former king of Imanity]].\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Sora claims that the \"strength\" of the Imanity come from their weakness. This gave Imanity the wisdom to run from magic and strength as well as the ability to learn and gain experience to predict the future. While this may be an ability any race may use, only the Imanity have been shown to use it, because of their overwhelming weakness.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Imanity lacks the ability to utilize elementals due to their lack of nerves that can connect to the [[Magic|Spirit Circuit]]. As such, they are unable to sense the presence of\u00a0magic nor can they utilize the Spirit Circuit to cast spells or enhance their physical capabilities. Also, they have been known as the weakest of the Exceed, not just magically, but they are physically weaker than the majority of Exceed.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                Before the Timeline of the Novels it has been discussed that Imanity once controlled the largest Territories and Domain on Disboard, dwarfing the lands of all the races that existed before the great war combined. It was often speculated on by the other Exceeds, as mentioned by [[Jibril]], that it seemed impossible for humanity to be capable of asserting itself and maintaining such large territories up to and during the great war. However, Imanity did not become extinct and maintained their large domain even up to the end of the great war.\n\n                In the [[Volume 6|6th light novel]], it is revealed that the Imanity during the time of the Great War were actually scattered all across the continent, forced into ghettos or settlements crudely put together. The Imanity constantly lived in fear that the wars between other races would affect their homes, to the point that a skirmish between 7-8 [[Dragonia|Dragonians]] and a battalion of [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] 9 miles away is enough to force 2000+ Imanitians to migrate. However, under the leadership of [[Riku]], the Imanity became a major player in the great war by covertly manipulating all the other races into their desired positions like chess pieces.\n\n                At the beginning of the [[Volume 1|1st light novel]], Imanity had only the city of [[Elchea]] and the lands surrounding it left before Sora and Shiro's reign. This is mainly due to the enactment of the [[Ten Pledges]] and Imanity's inability to sense the use of magic. Although Imanity was wise enough to survive the great war, they were incapable of defending themselves from opponents that would often cheat using magic. The result of this was the gradual loss of lands to the other magically dominant races over time until the period of the previous king.\n\n                As of [[Volume 5|5th light novel]], Sora and Shiro have recovered most of the previous kings lost lands that were cheated away from Imanity by the use of the virtual reality games by the werebeasts, The protagonists eventually game against the other races and form alliances with the [[Werebeast]], [[Fl\u00fcgel]], [[Dhampir]] and [[Seiren]] merging these lands to form the [[Elchea Federation]].\n\n                The name Imanity was given by [[Tet]] after the [[The Great War|Great War]] as they are the very first intelligent creatures on [[Disboard]], even before the gods or the [[:Old_Deus|old deus]] and was regarded by [[Tet]] as the world's \"immune system\" thus giving them the name Imanity.\n                [[File:Sora holding Imanity's Race Piece (King).png|thumb|left]]\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *According to Tet, all living beings in Disboard are creations of the [[Old Deus]] except the Imanity, the original occupants of the planet.\n                *The term 'Imanity' did not exist until after the Great War. Until then, they were simply referred to by the other races as 'humans' or 'talking monkeys.' It was Tet who blessed humans with the name 'Imanity', derived from the word 'immunity', in respect of their resolute and untainted spirit.\n                *The [[Race Piece|chess piece]] of the Imanity is the 'King', which is noticed by Sora to be the most strategically important piece despite the fact that it is one of the weakest pieces.\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n                [[es:Imanity]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",

Every living thing born on [[Disboard]] contains traces of Elementals. ([[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] were not born on Disboard, thus they contain no Elementals.) It is most concentrated in the erogenous zones. The body of a [[Fl\u00fcgel]] is said to be entirely made up of elementals, and the Elementals are most concentrated in their wings. The network, which elementals form within a body, is termed as an Elemental gallery. It is from this gallery that the races of the Exceed below the Elementals' rank (with the exception of Imanity) can control the flow of elementals to generate their specific abilities according to their race. In the [[Episode 06|sixth episode]], the siblings caused [[Jibril]]'s Elemental gallery to disappear during [[Materialization Shiritori|materialization shiritori]], which restricted her physical abilities and rendered her unable to fly. Jibril also brought an Elemental water infused shampoo for Shiro to use, which lessened Shiro's dislike of baths.\n\n                According to [[Volume 6]], elemental particles are originally blue in color. Imanity is unable to see this due to their lack of a connection to the Elemental Gallery. However, they can see dead elementals known as \"black ash\" (black to signify death, not its true color) or \"elemental bones\" as aquamarine-colored ash. This is very toxic and can be lethal if inhaled while also causing several other negative effects such as blindness if it gets into the eyes. However, if coated with elemental bones and swallowed, then magic won't affect you (or at least, you can't be read) due to the fact that elemental bones disrupt and break down a body's elementals (and all magic requires connecting to the elemental gallery).\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                * Fl\u00fcgels have the ability to detect what kind of Elementals an organism contains.\n                * [[Elves]] are able to examine one's personality from the Elemental particles they emit.\n                {{Exceed}}\n                [[es:Elemental]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",

Thus [[Imanity]] wins the game. Some time later, the siblings are summoned by the leader of the [[Werebeast]]s, the \"Shrine Maiden\" [[Miko]], who wants a rematch against them, just to be convinced to join their side instead and establish the [[Elchea Federation]] by merging the Imanity and Werebeast territories into a single nation. While making preparations for their next battles, Sora and Shiro renew their conviction to unite all the races of [[Disboard]] under their rule, and one day challenge [[Tet]] for the title of \"One True God\". But before they set off, Sora uses Miko as a connection between them and the [[Old Deus]], the number 1 ranked [[Exceed]], to tell them the game is on.\n\n                ==Characters==\n                The following\u00a0characters are listed by the order which they appear in.\n\n                ===Major characters===\n                *[[Sora]]\n                *[[Shiro]]\n                *[[Stephanie Dola]]\n                *[[Jibril]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Izuna]]\n                *[[Hatsuse Ino]]\n                *[[Chlammy Zell]]\n                *[[Fiel Nirvalen]]\n                *[[Miko]]\n\n                ===Minor characters===\n                *[[Tet]]\n\n                ;Non-speaking roles\n                *[[Plum]]\n                *[[Amira]]\n                *[[Azriel]]\n\n                ==Events==\n                #Izuna is defeated.\n                #Sora and Shiro are challenged by Miko.\n                #The game chosen is a coin toss.\n                #Sora intentionally causes a draw.\n                #The Eastern Federation joins with Elchea and the Elchean Federation is created.\n\n                ==Key differences from light novel==\n                #During the bath scene in the LN, Miko was not present.\n                #In the LN, Sora mentions that [[Fiel Nirvalen|Fii]] 's memories were altered only after Miko accepted that both of them would win but in the anime Sora mentions this before \u00a0conclusion is reached\n                #In the LN, Sora says that [[Avant Heim]] only came because Jibril asked them to and that they had no malicious intents but this was left unanswered in the anime.\n                #The last scene where an Old Deus is, is adapted from the very end of Volume 6 instead of [[Volume 3]] like most of the other part of the episode.\n\n                ==References==\n                <references />\u00a0[[pl:Odcinek 10]]\n                [[Category:Episodes]]\n                [[Category:Anime]]",
    "Embassy of Elchea": "\"The Embassy of Elchea was a huge building that stood near the border on the outskirts of Elchea. This was Elchea, the [[Eastern Union]] embassy. Inside was one of the many but most important bureaucrats which was the old Elchea Eastern Union embassy foreign [[Werebeast]] ambassador\" - [[Hatsuse Ino]]\n\n                The Embassy of Elchea was the former castle of [[Imanity]] before the [[former king of Imanity]] lost it in a game with the werebeasts. After it was converted into an embassy, the castle of Elchea and the Embassy of Elchea went into a massive construction war against each other over which would look more prestigious. Due to the merging of the Eastern Federation and Elchea into the Elchea Federation in [[Volume 3]], it is uncertain as to what has become of it.",
    "Laira": "[[File:Laira_LN_PIC.png|thumb|taken from the light novel color pages]]{{Parent Tab|maxwidth = 20|height = 2.2|tab1 = Information|tab2 = Image Gallery}}\n\n                Laira Lorelei is the current empress of the [[Seiren]] after her mother passed away. She entered into a cold sleep and has been sleeping for 800 years leading to the events of [[Volume 4]] of the light novel. However, after encountering [[Sora]]\u00a0in [[Volume 5]],she has awoken from her cold sleep and has willingly joined [[Oceando]], along with the Seirens and [[Dhampir]], into an alliance with the [[Elchea Federation]].\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                Like other Seiren, she is mainly humanoid with dress like fins on her feet and pointed ears. She has wavy blue hair and a youthful face. Has a snow-white body that is decorated with strips of gold. The lower half of her body has attractive scales on it, which reflect the light in the room.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                She is bored with life and seeks 'pure love' as she was born with everything: wealth, beauty and 'love' from anyone. She does not seem to care for how long she had been sleeping (V5C4). She also likes to reject people when they are deeply in love with her in a most brutal way.\n\n                Turns out, her definition of \"pure love\" is \"unobtainable love\" in which no matter how much she loves the other person, the person will not reciprocate it back. As such, it was the goal of her game to find this \"unobtainable love\" (in which [[Shiro]] found out before Sora despite deciphering people's intentions supposedly being his strength). After Sora defeated her, she has since fallen in love with him to the point of even calling him her \"Prince\" or, \"Emperor\".\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                As a Seiren, she has the ability to manipulate the water spirits within her body. This enables her to attract the spirits within other living things generating something similar to \"seduction [[magic]]\". However, due to the abnormally large amount of water spirits contained within her, Laira's ability to attract spirits is greatly enhanced even to the point of being able to seduce Sora and Shiro's group with the exception of Sora and Shiro themselves.\n\n                Laira, like any other Seiren, is also able to undergo a cold sleep in which she can sleep continuously for a thousand years or more. She does this by encasing herself in ice (it is unknown whether being frozen is necessary to undergo cold sleep) and has therefore been asleep like this for 800 years until the events of Volume 5.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                TBE\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *Due to her immense fertility as the Seiren Empress, she is able to reproduce even from the minute amount of soul essence found within a single lock of a male's hair. This is the case in which Sora and Laira now have a daughter despite no sexual intercourse and within a very fast gestation period.\n\n                ==Images==\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Female]]\n                [[Category:Seiren]]",

The race as a whole is represented by [[Miko]] while their [[Race Piece]] is a pawn. They have enhanced physical capabilities as well as senses, and are able to use 'kekkai' as a sixth sense to sense heart rate and other minute details. There are countless different tribes of Werebeasts, each of which have different physical features but all have animal-like attributes.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                The Werebeasts generally have heightened senses and physical abilities above that of many of the races ranked seven or below, otherwise categorized as the Living Beings races. This is done by controlling the [[Elemental|Elementals]] within their bodies to allow them to attain superhuman capabilities along with sensory acuteness in all five senses and being able to detect the presence of magic. While they were considered to have a sixth sense to read minds, it was revealed to be just a combination of their heightened five senses to detect involuntary and voluntary body movements to determine possible intentions (known as cold reading) and changes in heart rate to determine if someone is lying or not, similar to a [[wikipedia:polygraph|polygraph]]. \n\n                A select few are capable of enhancing their abilities to beyond their physical capabilities and possibly the laws of physics for a set amount of time in what is known as Blood Destruction. The Blood Destruction form can be identified by the iconic red staining of the eyes, hair, fur, and parts of the skin (generally forming an intricate skin pattern on at least the forehead and under the eyes that are unique to each individual) with the red color being derived from the person's blood breaking from either the breaking of the capillaries or from the uncontrollable flow of their blood. After reverting back to his/her original form, the red coloring of their Blood Destruction form disappears thereby assuming his/her blood returning back to the blood stream.\n\n                The Werebeast are currently seen as the most technologically advanced race on [[Disboard]], although there are some vast disparities between the Werebeast technology and that of our own, such as a lack of flight technologies and portable computers. The majority of their people also live in Eastern (Japanese) style housing from the 1700's. The main focus of their technological advancment appears to surround improving agriculture and mining to make use of what land they have to its fullest such as advanced food production facilities (most likely hydroponic based) as well as advanced computing by means of virtual simulation as seen in the game between the protagonists and [[Izuna]].\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Despite the remarkable abilities the Werebeasts possess due to their heightened sense and physical abilities, this comes at a cost. The ability to manipulate the control of their body's elementals causes a disorder within the body's flow of elementals. This leaves them with a chronic discomfort that is worse in those with frail bodies and are most often noticeable in children and women in general. The temporary alleviation to it is correcting the flow of elementals either by high level magic or (in the case of [[Sora]] and [[Shiro]]) a very good massage.\n\n                As expected, Blood Devastation also has a price to pay for its use. Its use puts an enormous strain on the body such that it could cause muscle tears, bone fractures, nerve damage, and possibly fatal heart damage. As such, Werebeasts with this ability tend to limit its use in short bursts and for dire situations only.\n\n                Although Werebeasts have the ability to detect the use of magic, they themselves are incapable of using it. As such, this weakness proves to be one of the reasons behind the defensive stance of the Werebeasts against other nations as their heightened abilities are still no match against magic. Rather, the Werebeasts resolve this through their use of video games where magic is unable to be used in virtual reality thus allowing their heightened physical abilities and experience in virtual gaming (they are the only nation in the world of Disboard that has the capabilities to produce video games) to give them an overwhelming advantage.\n\n                The advanced technology of the Werebeasts require a vast amount of resources in order to maintain. As such, depriving the Werebeasts of such resources can lead to severe problems within the nation (i.e. economic recession, technological stagnation, etc). This desperate need for resources is what ultimately caused the downfall of the Eastern Federation and the rise of the Elchean Federation due to the exploitation of the [[former king of Imanity]] to retain his memories in exchange to keep challenging them with Imanity's continental land and the resulting challenge from Miko to Sora after losing all of the continental land the Werebeasts had.\n\n                Due to their heightened senses and physical prowess, the Werebeasts require a significantly larger amount of food to sustain them. However, the issue of food shortage has not been much of an addressed issue as of yet.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                For many years the Werebeast had been locked in a cycle between civil wars and negotiated peace, a small country of islands with little uniformity. However, one day, Miko appeared and pacified the country in just half a century, and now they had merged into a gigantic maritime nation counted as the third biggest country on Disboard.\n\n                As a united nation, their technology advanced rapidly and thus started to require a vast amount of resources to sustain their growth; resources that their nation of islands could not provide. Before they could attempt to expand to the mainland, they were challenged by the [[Elves]] for a total of four times. By then, the Werebeasts possessed videogaming technology which was never seen before on Disboard. Thereby, they used this to their advantage to beat the elves while wiping out their memories to keep their advantage a secret. Regardless, the elves were able to piece together the game through their losses purely by the results of each of their four games (of which were all losses). After the fourth loss, however, the elves realize that it is a game they did not understand (videogames were unknown to the rest of Disboard as stated above) and thus stopped challenging the Werebeasts. From the four games against the elves, the Werebeasts gained a significant amount of land. However, the land they gained were islands that did not contain the wealth of resources they need. What's more, the games conducted with the elves and the condition of losing the memories of the game acted as a great deterrent for any other race to challenge the Werebeasts. Offensively, the Werebeasts would be unable to go up against the magic of the other races and thus would be in a losing situation. With this predicament, the Eastern Federation would never be able to satisfy the demand for resources.\n\n                In their desperate situation, they were ultimately saved when the former king of Imanity decided to challenge them for a total of eight times within a decade before Sora and Shiro appeared on Disboard. For each game, the former king bet a piece of the mainland that was useless to Imanity at the time for a coastal city of the Eastern Federation. However, perhaps to encourage the previous king to keep challenging to obtain more continental land, they allowed him to keep his memory of the games provided he does not speak about it for the remainder of his life. After the eighth time, the former king stopped challenging the Werebeasts. However, the Werebeasts got the land and the resources they needed to expand their growth.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                TBE\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n                [[es:Bestias Guerreras]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",
    "Template talk:Welcome": "==How to use the template==\n                Just type or copy the text <nowiki>{{subst:welcome|YourUsername |~~~~}}</nowiki> onto a user's Talk page then add your signature. As soon as you Save, the entry will lose its link to the template and become ordinary text, which you can edit to personalise it.\n\n                ==Use of \"subst:\" prefix==\n                Using the prefix before any template name copies the template then cuts the connection. If you omit the \"subst:\" the result copies just the same but will not be editable and will always show the current version of the template - probably not a good idea for a one-off welcoming message, although it is useful for many other templates.\n\n                ==Edit it to make it more specific to this wiki==\n                For example, it could say \"Welcome to the '''<font color=blue>XYZWV Wiki</font>'''\".    You could add a link to a page you particularly want new users to look at.   You could use the \"upload file\" link to add a new picture that is meaningful (or funny!) to your visitors, and change the code <nowiki>[[Image:Example.jpg]]</nowiki> to the name of your new picture.\n\n                ==Make another one just for you to use==\n                On your user page you could create a link to something like <nowiki>[[template:welcJG]]</nowiki> then make the resulting page a copy of [[template:welcome]] and modify it any way you like. Then you can type or paste <nowiki>{{subst:welcJG}}</nowiki> on a newcomer's page and not need further personalising.\n\n                == Auto sign ==\n                You can get the template to automatically include the user's signature, but it will only work when it's substituted. If it's transcluded the four tildes will show. I guess you have to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages; you can easily include the subst: code in [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]], but you run the risk of experienced users just transcluding it.\n\n                == PAGENAME ==\n                A good idea is to include the <nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki> magic word, that way the user feels like it's more of a personal welcome. This can be either directly transcluded, or substituted. There are problems with both options. For direct transclusion, the welcome will show the full pagename (e.g. User talk:Name/Archive2), if it's ever archived. For substitution, the whole template needs to be substituted for it to work. Otherwise, the pagename magic word will show. The same problem is faced as with auto signing; more experienced users are likely to just transclude it.\n\n                [[Category:Help]]",
    "The Great War": "'''The Great War''' is a war between different races that began so far in the past that nobody remembers clearly and ended at around six thousand years ago. The war was caused by the gods, or the Old Deus as they are later called, to obtain the [[Star Cup]], which has the power to do anything and thus will be the crowned the Only God or the True God. The war was won by [[Tet]] by default in the end, and after [[Tet]] claimed the Star Cup, he forbid all violence and thus created the [[Ten Pledges]].\n\n                During the war, the sky was bleached red and falling blue ash-like particles covered the land. These were said to be the remains of dead spirits, and were highly poisonous to any part of any living body it came contact with. The world seemed to have been much colder, although still warm enough for humans to not die. The attacks of the stronger races frequently transformed the land and changed the landscape. Much less animals lived during this time. Humans could only survive by living secretly in caves and sending scouts to scavenge the wreckages left from battles between other races.\n                ==Note==\n                *Judging by [[Azriel]]'s age, the war most probably lasted for around 20,000 years.\n                *At the end of [[Volume 8]], an Ex Machina states that it has been 54,355,146 hours since the end of the war.

They are the only Creature Form race capable of casting multiple spells at once. This advantage has allowed them an edge in games against other Creature Form races due to their unmatched usage of magic as a way to cheat and manipulate games.

The names of the other countries which the rest of the races reside have yet to be revealed.\n\n                ==Ranking==\n                {| class=\"article-table\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |Rank\n                ! scope=\"col\" |Name\n                ! scope=\"col\" |Japanese\n                ! scope=\"col\" |Country\n                ! scope=\"col\" |[[Race Piece]]\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |1\n                |'''[[Old Deus]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u795e\u970a\u7a2e|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c7\u30a6\u30b9}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |2\n                |'''[[Phantasma]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u5e7b\u60f3\u7a2e|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ba\u30de}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |3\n                |'''[[Elemental]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u7cbe\u970a\u7a2e|\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |4\n                | '''[[Dragonia]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u9f8d\u7cbe\u7a2e|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30cb\u30a2}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |5\n                | '''[[Gigant]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u5de8\u4eba\u7a2e|\u30ae\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |6\n                | '''[[Fl\u00fcgel]]'''\n                | {{ruby|\u5929\u7ffc\u7a2e|\u30d5\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb}}\n                |[[Avant Heim]]\u2192[[Elchea Federation]]\n                |Queen\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |7\n                | '''[[Elf]]'''\n                | {{ruby|\u68ee\u7cbe\u7a2e|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5}}\n                |[[Elven Gard]]\n                | Rook\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |8<ref name=\"TVANGNLCFB\">TV Animation No Game No Life Complete Fanbook</ref>\n                | '''[[Dwarf]]'''\n                | {{ruby|\u5730\u7cbe\u7a2e|\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30d5}}\n                | [[Harden Fell]]\n                |Bishop\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |9<ref name=\"TVANGNLCFB\" />\n                | '''[[Fairy]]'''\n                | {{ruby|\u5996\u7cbe\u7a2e|\u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |10\n                | '''[[Ex-machina]]\u00a0'''\n                | {{ruby|\u6a5f\u51f1\u7a2e|\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30de\u30ad\u30ca}}\n                |\n                |Bishop\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |11<ref name=\"TVANGNLCFB\" />\n                | '''[[Demonia]]'''\n                | {{ruby|\u5996\u9b54\u7a2e|\u30c7\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2}}\n                |\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |12\n                |'''[[Dhampir]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u5438\u8840\u7a2e|\u30c0\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb}}\n                |[[Oceando]]\u2192[[Elchea Federation]]\n                |Knight\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |13\n                |'''[[Lunamana]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u6708\u8a60\u7a2e|\u30eb\u30ca\u30de\u30ca}}\n                |\n                |Rook\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |14\n                |'''[[Werebeast]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u7363\u4eba\u7a2e|\u30ef\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8}}\n                |[[Eastern Union|Eastern Federation]]\u2192[[Elchea Federation]]\n                |Pawn\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |15\n                |'''[[Seiren]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u6d77\u68f2\u7a2e|\u30bb\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3}}\n                |[[Oceando]]\u2192[[Elchea Federation]]\n                |Knight\n                |-\n                ! scope=\"row\" |16\n                |'''[[Imanity]]'''\n                |{{ruby|\u4eba\u985e\u7a2e|\u30a4\u30de\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3}}\n                |[[Elchea Kingdom]]\u2192[[Elchea Federation]]\n                |King\n                |}\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n\n                ==References==\n                <references />\n                [[es:Exceed]]\n                [[Category:Terminology]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]",

Considered the \"God of War\". He is believed to have died during the [[The Great War|Great War]], before the [[Ten Pledges]] were implemented by [[Tet]].\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                Artosh is a hulk of a man, standing at over double the height of a regular man. He is described as sporting bulging muscles all over his body, a strong black beard, and bright golden eyes. He has 18 pairs of wings on his back that, when not in use, entirely drape over his back like a feathered cape.\u00a0\n\n                ==Personality==\n                Artosh is extremely prideful, calling himself the 'strongest being alive' and constantly boasting of his unbridled power compared to the other 'weeds'. However, he is also known to be eccentric and mysterious, always hoping for an opponent worthy enough to face him head-on.\n\n                ==History==\n                Artosh originally created the Fl\u00fcgel as a means of dispatching the other Old Deus, with Azriel responsible for conveying his will to the rest of the Fl\u00fcgel. He resides in the throne chamber of [[Avant Heim]] all day long, giving Azriel his orders and then looking down on the world below from atop his throne with disinterest. However, during the climax of the Great War, when the [[Ex-machina]] collectively reproduced over a thousand Airstrikes to provoke the Union, Artosh retaliated by gathering all of the Fl\u00fcgels' power to unleash his ultimate attack, Godstrike. Firing Godstrike left Artosh and the Fl\u00fcgel weakened and exhausted, a situation which was exploited by [[Riku]] and the Ex-machina to infiltrate Avant Heim and take him out.\n                [[Category:Old Deus]]\n                [[Category:Article stubs]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Male]]",

[[Sora]] described the exterior of the building to resemble the Library of Congress, located in Washington, D.C.\n\n                Inside the library, there are bookshelves piled up against the wall and ceiling, inevitably defying the laws of gravity. There are numerous light orbs floating in the air and bookshelves that were tens of meters tall, constructing a maze-like situation filled with a fantasy-like atmosphere.<ref>Volume 2, Chapter 2</ref> It also contains a fully stocked kitchen, and the equipment to conduct a game of [[Materialization Shiritori]].\n\n                The library was originally controlled by [[Imanity]], but was lost to Jibril through a game. Sora challenged Jibril for the right to own her (and thus the library), and won, thus Imanity once again owns the library. Sora allows Jibril to continue her use of the library, and gave her the books stored in his tablet that she had bet for. Jibril now manages the library, which college students and any literate person can come to use.\n                [[File:Ep5 screenshots (203).png|thumb|left|290px|National Library of Elchea (exterior view)]]{{Clr}}\n                ==References==\n                <references/>\n\n                [[pl:Narodowa Biblioteka Elchea]]\n                [[Category:Location]]",

Her love towards knowledge started even before the declaration of the [[Ten Oaths]]. She opposes the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left [[Avant Heim]], her homeland, to win the [[National Library of Elchea]] from the [[previous king]] in a game. When [[Sora]] heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and [[Shiro]]'s servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she must now share it with the rest of [[Imanity]]. Thus, Jibril took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans. Unlike [[Steph]], Jibril is happy to become the siblings' underling, and is shown to have grown feelings toward Sora. \n\n                According to [[Azriel]], Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by [[Artosh]]. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Fl\u00fcgels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                She has long purple-pink hair with wings near her hip. Her pupils are purple surrounded by a gold iris but a cross shape appears in her pupils when she is focusing for a task (such as performing a spell). Her ears are wing-shaped and she also has a halo over her head. She usually has her midriff exposed and wears a long skirt. She has also a slim and well-endowed body. She looks like she is 17-18 years old but in reality she is much older.\n\n                ==Personality==\n                She seems to be soft spoken and polite, but she can also be incredibly condescending to other races of the [[Exceed]] below her own, as shown when she indirectly insults Stephanie Dola and when she refuses to apologize to [[Fiel Nirvalen]] for wrecking havoc, also when told she had to lick Fiel's feet she refused saying she would not lick a 'mere' elf's foot. She has a great love for knowledge and gets easily excited at the prospect of gaining new knowledge, such as when she drooled over Sora's tablet after seeing the vast information it contained. Despite her initial arrogance, she has a high sense of honor while playing games, as she doesn't like cheating, or being cheated. She tends to remember the \"good old \" days before the oaths were established and when everything could be solved by killing, in a rather disturbing way, somewhat showing her sadistic personality.\u00a0\n\n                Unlike Steph, Jibril fully embraces her servitude to Sora and Shiro, going so far as addressing them both as \"Master.\" Throughout the anime and light novel, Jibril's feelings for Sora seem to grow, despite stating she's not supposed to have the feeling called love. Jibril first stated her feelings in [[Episode 10]] wondering even though it's supposed to be humiliating that she licked Fi's foot, if she takes it as a order from the master she gets excited, questioning whether it could be love, before Sora interrupted her.\u00a0Despite this, in [[Volume 4]] Jibril has expressed a willingness to merge a part of Sora's soul with her own to attempt to create a hybrid, essentially showing a willingness to bear his child. Later on, in [[Volume 5]], she confesses to Sora that she can finally understand love (or her perceptive of it) and has fallen in love with him.\n\n                ==History==\n                Jibril was the last and most powerful Flugel created by the [[Old Deus]] Artosh\u00a0and served under him until his demise. During the war of the gods she destroyed the capital of [[Elven Gard]]e with a single spell, called \"[[Heaven's Strike]],\" which resulted in Jibril not being able to use [[magic]] for 5 years. Afterwards Jibril stole all the books in Elven Garde despite the Elves best attempts to prevent this. Due to the loss of so many books, the Elves lost a considerable amount of magic and, as stated by [[Fiel Nirvalen|Fiel]], it took over 800 years to regain all the lost powers.\n\n                Sometime during the Great War, while embarking on one of her solo campaigns, she came across an [[Ex-machina]] named [[Shuvi]]. Ex-machina heads were extremely rare prizes amongst the Flugel, because at the time there was an unspoken rule to never provoke the Ex-machina lest one seeks ruin. However, Jibril was confident she could take down Shuvi, so she had no choice but to retaliate. Despite her greatest efforts, Shuvi was ultimately defeated and killed by Jibril. However, Jibril did not escape unscathed, as she had used Heaven's Strike against Shuvi and lost all of her magic power.\n\n                After Artosh was defeated and the war concluded, Jibril lived in the Flugel city Avant Heim for some time. However with the passage of the Book-Sharing Law, she decided to leave as she did not agree with it and did not want her books passed along freely. Sometime after she challenged the Imanity King for the rights to his library, which she easily won. Jibril then stayed at her library until being challenged by Sora and Shiro, where she lost in a game of [[Materialization Shiritori]]. In accordance with the bets for the game, she swore her very being to Sora and Shiro. Although not requested by Sora and Shiro, Jibril would go on to accept the siblings as her new masters, seemingly having replaced Artosh.\n\n                Jibril would then follow the siblings on their quest to reach [[Tet]], the one and only God. This included helping them in their quest to acquire the [[Werebeast]] nation, [[Dhampir]] and [[Seiren]] Nation, and even a trip to her homeland, Avant Heim. Along the way, she has been documenting their actions in her own book.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n                As the final unit and most powerful individual of the Fl\u00fcgel race, her massive strength was hinted at by Azrael who stated that, were she to assist Sora and Shiro in playing a game of tag against 100 other Fl\u00fcgel, the match wouldn't be considered a competition at all. It is unknown what her full capabilities are (disregarding Heaven's Strike). However, parting a pathway through the sea to Oceande is apparently a representation of 5% of her full strength.\u00a0 Her speed is also incredible, capable of moving, maneuvering, and reacting well pass the speed of sound with ease.\u00a0 All of her senses are unrivaled, for example she was capable of perfectly seeing and locking on the elves base, even though she was miles above in the sky, it was night and there was smoke everywhere.\u00a0 \n\n                As a member of the Fl\u00fcgel race she is absolutely immortal, possessing an infinite life span: immune to all diseases, illnesses, disorders, toxins, impurities, and physical and/or mental interference; she is entirely self-sustained; will never age (always remain in her physical and mental prime) and is immune to aging abilities; she is virtually invulnerable to all harm as shown when she was shot by the elves she only fell out of flight course, but was physically unharmed, and even if she is injured she can regenerate from any injury. \u00a0As the most powerful Fl\u00fcgel her immortality, invulnerability and regenerative capabilities are vastly superior to any of her race. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n                As a Fl\u00fcgel she possess a limitless level of intellectual (memory, calculation, learning, creativity, IQ, etc.) and cognitive (observing, deduction, tactical analysis, multitasking, combat, movement, etc.) proficiency that is of the highest level in existence, essentially a limitless IQ and intellectual capacity.\u00a0 This is shown in the ability of the Fl\u00fcgel \u00a0to start \u201cstealing\u201d all knowledge after the ten pledges are established as an alternative to their practice of taking heads, since absorbing the knowledge of all others is the same as taking their head.\u00a0 Jibril possess unlimited storage capacity, she is able to perform several mental functions at once without losing focus on any of them. Her mind allows her to instantly recall specific information with incredible speed and perfect accuracy. She is able to store everything that she experiences and retrieve it immediately without the typical human pause for thought. The speed of her thoughts augments her analytical ability so that she is able to make snap decisions about her surroundings and create complex scenarios at high speed. She is able to track the probability of an event by piecing together stored data, and is able to perform multiple tasks at once by allocating a portion of her brain to each task. She can use her mind to replay an event that occurred during the war she has seen, play a game, and focus on battling an opponent simultaneously without any one task distracting her from another.\u00a0 She was told Sora that she can speak, read, writes, understand, and communicate in any and all forms of languages.\u00a0 The knowledge she has gathered during her millennia of existence are incredibly vast.\u00a0 However it is not perfect or infallible, as she lost to Sora and Shiro. She's also a very competent mage, capable of using spells to teleport herself, Sora, Shiro and Steph to any place she can see or that she's been to previously. She's also capable of phasing through walls at will.\n\n                It is said that Jibril has once used a spell called \"Heaven's Strike,\" also called \"Airstrike,\" which had completely annihilated the capital of Elven Garde. As a drawback, she could not use any magic for 5 years. In Volume 5 of the novels she uses the power again but does not suffer from any recoil as she was in an illusionary world where her magic power was unlimited.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n                Due to being a Fl\u00fcgel, Jibril is very dismissive of other races below her own and her confidence in her own knowledge. This in turn causes her to overlook the potential threat posed by the said races. This is no more evident than in her game with the siblings, that even with the knowledge from her examination of Sora (that the siblings weren't from [[Disboard]]), she still regarded Sora and Shiro with barely concealed scorn, but was intrigued by the discovery.\n\n                Sora mentioned that Jibril lost in her game of Materialization Shiritori because of her arrogance. For example, the game could have ended in Jibril's favor in the first move where Sora and Shiro called upon a Hydrogen Bomb. Instead Jibril shielded them from the blast because, as Sora predicted, it would have been boring for her.\n\n                Jibril has an over-curious nature in which she becomes very enthused at the thought of learning or discovering something new. As such, she can be bribed in exchange for knowledge she doesn't know (although finding something she doesn't know is challenging as she has been learning for thousands of years).\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                *While the name Jibril has been noted to be an Arabic reading of\u00a0[[wikipedia:Gabriel|Gabriel]], the author stated that Jibril was not related to the figure.<ref>[https://twitter.com/yuukamiya68/statuses/443528297738014720 Twitter post by author]</ref>\n                *As the \"final unit\" of the Flugel, Jibril's power is capable enough to kill a [[Gigant]], a [[Dragonia]], and a [[Phantasma]] on separate solo campaigns.

The first chapter of this manga was published on January 27, 2013, in the March volume of Monthly Comic Alive, and then they are combined into this manga volume which released on November 22, 2013.\n                ==Plot summary==\n                ===Game 01.Prologue===\n                The chapter began with [[Queen]] challenging\u00a0[[\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f]] and then losing. She then discussed about them with her guild member, which result in admiration and the spread of an urban legend. However in reality, [[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] controlling \u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f were just hikikomori hidden in their home. They later received emails from an unknown source, which invited them to play a chess game by questioning if they feel like they were born in a wrong world. Having successfully defeated the [[Tet|challenger]] with unprecedented strength, the challenger continued asking them if they felt they were born in the wrong world, and then teleported them to his world,\u00a0[[Disboard]]. He proclaimed himself as god. The chapter ended when they landed on Disboard and the siblings declared that the terrible game that is life had finally bugged out.\n\n                ===Game 02.{{ruby|Amateur|Beginner}} \u2460===\n                ===Game 03.{{ruby|Amateur|Beginner}} \u2461===\n                ===Game 04.{{ruby|Amateur|Beginner}} \u2462===\n                ===Game 05.{{ruby|Challenger|Challenger}}===\n                ===Attached Short Story 5 years ago===\n                ==Characters appeared==\n                * [[Sora]]\n                * [[Shiro]]\n                * [[Tet]]\n                * [[Queen]]\n                * [[dora]]\n\n                == English Manga & Light Novel ==\n                * [http://global.bookwalker.jp/deec0ae686-f37c-4fd0-b45b-dfe1f2ee254b/?adpcnt=7qM_VsbO No Game No Life Vol. 1] (English)\n                [[Category:Manga]]",

After the king's death, she gambled to become the next queen of the country. Although she was forced by the [[pledges]] to fall in love with [[Sora]] after losing a game to him in [[Episode 02]], she has since developed feelings for him despite denying these feelings on a consistent basis. In the short story that comes with Blu-ray DVD, Steph actually lost a bit of her mind when she was defeated by Sora again and again.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                Stephanie is an [[Imanity]] girl with short red hair that is decorated with a large blue flower. She has blue eyes and a curvy figure with rather large breasts. In the first episode, she wore an elegant dress given to her by her grandfather. However, after losing it to [[Chlammy Zell|Chlammy]], she had to wear a towel before being dressed by Sora in a dress made from a bed sheet. Once the siblings beat Chlammy in a game for the crown of Imanity, Steph regained the dress and has become the main staple for her clothing. Her three sizes are from above, 89, 58, 89.\n\n                ==Personality==\n                Stephanie is expressive and emotional, wearing her heart on her sleeve to the point where she cannot hide her emotions during a poker game. She loved her grandfather dearly and is angered when people call her grandfather a fool. She fell in love with Sora due to the pledges forcing her to, and she often has violent outbursts to try to break free of it. However, [[Jibril]] later stated that the pledge did not specify a time frame, and so should have worn off, meaning Stephanie had probably truly fallen for Sora. She loves her kingdom and world and believes in the potential of Imanity (humans).\n                [[File:Stephanie_Dora.png|thumb|left|350px]]{{Clr}}\n\n                ==Strengths==\n                Stephanie is shown to actually be quite smart, being the top of her class. Unlike Sora and Shiro, Stephanie is able to make friends very easily, making communicating and gathering information from other (normal) people possible for Sora and Shiro. She also has contacts to most of the noble families in [[Elchea]], which aids her in diplomatic resolution when trying to pacify opposing feudal lords who reject Sora's radical policies.\n\n                Though she is often ridiculed as nothing more than a \"Steph\" by Sora and Shiro, giving off the impression that she is an idiot in comparison to the main cast. In actuality, Stephanie is very proficient at games, especially games that rely on both luck and skill such as poker. She also shows an extraordinary level of competency as she uses her grandfather's technique of observing and analyzing the opponent's game style in order to beat them in a game later on. Hatsune Ino once even commented on her skills, calling her \"Imanity's strongest gamer\" next to Blank. However, this usually means losing the first few round of games (and suffering the consequences) before making a comeback in the later games when she has determined an effective counter to the opponent's methods. \n\n                Stephanie does show genuine acts of kindness and loyalty towards her friends, and towards her kingdom. She was prepared suffer loss after loss against Sora and Shiro at the loss of her clothing in public just to get them to stop slacking off and run the kingdom in a manner similar to her grandfather. Although she seems to follow his principles a bit too literally, she doesn't give up, believing if they just keep trying Imanity can regain it's lost territory.  \n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n                Stephanie is a somewhat naive girl, and is sometimes too trusting which tends to get her caught in bad situations, or being scolded by Sora for letting her optimism and trusting nature cloud her judgement. Though she is deemed rather intelligent, even to the surprise of Sora, Shiro and others at times, she often over-thinks certain aspects of a situation causing her to skip over other details or possibilities. Although she is able to understand Sora's and Shiro's strategies, she's unable to grasp them unless explained - and is usually left uninformed and to fend for herself, (though she is a key factor to their victories).\n\n                She is also short-tempered and emotionally sensitive, causing her to go from one extreme another, (from being cheerfully obedient to regretfully upset and banging her head off of a wall in an instance, but that may be due to the effects of the pledge that Sora has her under,) and making her an easy target for psychological torment during games or for comical effects from pledges she must uphold (usually as punishments from either Sora or Shiro from constantly challenging and losing to them).\n\n                Her way of thinking, which was taught to her by late grandfather, and former king, where constantly challenging and hoping for a victory, either through learning a winning method or in the case of her victory against Sora--hoping to find a game of pure chance and winning based on luck-though ultimately isn't a weakness, has left her in her current position to fulfill her pledge to Sora, as well as frequently getting her into embarrassing situations, (besides being the reason that Imanity is losing against the other races). Although this method is purely trial and error and means suffering and losing just to create a chance for a victory, needs a strong will and sharp mind in order for it to be successful, though it worked on behalf of the late king, Stephanie is still searching for a true game of pure-chance to which she can beat Sora at, though her knowledge and understanding of [[Kuuhaku]] and their methodology has improved greatly because of this method and the sibling's tutelage.\n\n                ==Character==\n\n                Stephanie is a sociable person who has many friends from school. She is easily shocked by Sora's actions, like his sudden declaration of war against other countries, and usually overreacts about it. She is also kindhearted; trying to resolve all conflicts with the opposing parties peacefully.<ref>Anime [[Episode 05]]</ref> While she dislikes and protests at being left alone to handle Elchea's affairs for the siblings, she does her job capably.

He is protective towards his granddaughter, and becomes unhappy and jealous whenever she is close to the siblings. According to \"[[Miko]]\", he has thirty wives. He was possibly one of the participants of the games between Imanity's [[Former king of Imanity|ex-king]] and the Werebeasts.\n\n                In the anime, Ino has a brief speaking role in [[Episode 04]], but his official appearance is in [[Episode 08]].\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                He is described as a mostly white figure due to his long white hair, tail and ears. Despite his old age, he has enormous muscles that show through his kimono. He is often seen wearing his kimono and round glasses although when it comes to beach/bathing attire, he switches to a red loincloth but keeps his glasses.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                He acts in a rather formal manner around guests and officials. However, when around rude or condescending people, he tends to reciprocate their attitudes back despite their diplomatic rank.\n\n                He expresses a caring attitude for those he knows, especially his granddaughter, even though his outer expression may suggest otherwise.\n\n                Though not during his jobs, he speaks many dirty jokes.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                TBE\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                TBE\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                The light novels mention Ino and Steph-kou have a bond, as they are both victims of Sora's manipulation\n\n                (Steph-kou is a joke, as Ino pointed out Stephanie is Stephanie-kou or Duchess, and Izuna abbreviated it to Steph-kou.)\n                [[Category:Werebeast]]",

The letter was intercepted by an unnamed Imanity and retrieved by Jibril. Sora and the others were shocked to find out that the game match was on that very day, and Steph was constantly worrying over Sora and Shiro's informal attire and whether they were adequately prepared.

    "Materialization Shiritori": "[[File:Ep6_screenshot_(49).png|thumb|300px]]\n                '''Materialization Shiritori''' is (generally) the only game that the [[Fl\u00fcgel]] play when challenged. It mainly utilizes a floating, glowing light-blue crystal that will translate the words of the players into the [[magic]] needed to materialize or remove the object stated. It was used in the [[Episode 06|sixth episode]], in a match between [[Kuhaku|the siblings]] and [[Jibril]], and also later as a component of the match of 'Memory Stealing Othello' between [[Sora]] and [[Chlammy Zell]].\n\n                ==Rules==\n                Similar to the normal [[wikipedia:Shiritori|Shiritori]] rules, each player takes turns to give a noun which does not end with ''N''. The last character of the previous word said must be the first character of the next word to be said. Things that are present will disappear, and things that are not present will materialize. Players cannot cause the direct death of each other by stating vital components of the body. The noun stated must be a non-imaginary word. Sora noted that words which are non-imaginary but the opponent does not know of can also be used.\n\n                The conditions for losing are:<ref>[[Volume 2]]: Chapter 2, Part 4</ref>\n                #Using a word that has already been said\n                #Being unable to answer within 30 seconds\n                #Being unable to continue\n\n                In addition, when a word is stated, the effect is based on the meaning intended by the player who stated it. For instance, if [Meat] was stated and Sora was thinking of a sexy blonde woman, the latter will appear.<ref>Volume 2: Afterwords</ref> In the game played between the siblings and Jibril, when Sora states [Mantle], which can mean either a loose sleeveless cloak or the term referring to a portion of the interior of the Earth, the latter disappears.\n\n                ==History==\n                The words used in the match between the siblings and Jibril are listed below.

Founders are also given bureaucrat access so they can make any other user on their wiki an administrator or bureaucrat.

On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community portal or [[Forum:Index|Forum]], or ask a bureaucrat directly on his or her talk page.\n\n                If there are no active bureaucrats, use the \"Requests for adminship\" page to nominate users to become admins or bureaucrats.

Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in [[w:Assume good faith|good faith]].

Though its existence has been speculated upon for many eons, [[Riku]] is able to figure out that the Star Cup is actually a term for the core of the planet's Spirit Circuit network which provides all living beings on [[Disboard]] with [[magic]]. Thus, he concludes that if one is able to possess the core, they will obtain more than enough power to call themselves the One True God.\n\n                To that end, Riku spends a year discreetly planning and manipulating the movements of the other races' armies. His goal was to force the armies into a situation where they all had to unleash their ultimate attacks on each other, which would then be directed by the [[Ex-machina]] towards the planet's physical core, therefore damaging the core of the Spirit Circuit network and forcing the Star Cup to reveal itself. However, this plan was eventually found to be flawed, and instead of attempting to control the combined wave of ultimate attacks, the Ex-machina reproduced a version of the combination attack in the form of a massive gun called the Starslayer, which they entrusted to Riku.\n\n                Using the Starslayer, Riku penetrated the planet's core and released the reserves of magic energy stored within the planet, which were compressed and gathered into a polygonal crystal RIku believed to be the Star Cup. Deeming himself unworthy of the title of One True God, Riku's strong wish for the existence of an 'ultimate gamer' and the incredible surge of magic energy pouring out from the planet's core gave birth to the final and weakest Old Deus - [[Tet]]. Promising to play a game with Riku and [[Shuvi]] in the future with a smile, Tet claimed ownership of the Star Cup and used its power to lay down the [[Ten Pledges]], thus ending the Great War and fulfilling Riku and Shuvi's dream of a peaceful world.\u00a0\n                [[Category:Items]]",

Her title allows her first say during emergencies but any other decisions still must go through the Council of Eighteen Wings (of which she is a member). She is on the cover of [[Volume 5]] and appears in [[episode 12]]. She was the first [[Fl\u00fcgel]] created and thus is the oldest amongst them. Her role during [[The Great War]] was a conveyor of [[Artosh]]'s will to the rest of the Flugel. She was responsible for passing the law regarding the sharing of books among the Fl\u00fcgel.\n\n                It is revealed in Volume 5 that Azriel has a mental connection to the [[Phantasma]] [[Avant Heim]] and is considered its representative.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                She has an appearance similar to that of the other Fl\u00fcgel, an angelic-like being, but with some notable differences. She has a medium length mostly green hair and her eyes are heterochromic (her right eye is blue, the left one is golden). Unlike the other Flugels, she possesses a curved horn on the left side of her head, possibly representing her dual nature. Like Jibril, she also has her midriff exposed and wears a long skirt.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                She seems to have a somewhat split personality that changes depending on who she is conversing with. Her personality seems to deviate mostly between a peppy, emotional state and a cold, relentless state (similar to Jibril's killing intent but a lot easier to identify in comparison to her emotional state).\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Even by Flugel standards, she is immensely strong, having been the First Unit of Artosh's army, and being able to call on the powers of a second-ranked Phantasma, Avant Heim. In one such instance where she does so, Sora and Shiro, moving at over the speed of sound, are described as moving \"as slow as a snail\" to her.\n                She is also very skilled at deception, successfully convincing the other Flugel that only she could order them to commit suicide, and forbidding it without her say-so, a lie that prevented their mass suicide after Artosh's defeat that remained unchallenged for over six thousand years. On first encountering Sora and Shiro, she convincingly seemed prepared to lose a game to them in order to get closer to Jibril, when in reality she intended to free her from service to them.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Though she is smart, she has a great deal of difficulty understanding the importance of trying, learning, and failing, and particularly Jibril's actions. She is closed-minded to an extent that she is still oblivious to this \"answer\" even when many of the other Flugel seem to have found it.\n                She also cares deeply for Jibril, trying (and failing) to convince the Council of Eighteen Wings to refer to her as \"imouto\", and stating that she would bet the Flugel's [[Race Piece]] for videos of her bathing. As such, harsh words from Jibril cut her to the quick, and cause her to become nihilistic.\n                Also, even with Avant Heim's power within her, she is susceptible to the deception magic of a [[Dhampir]] who has absorbed a powerful Spirit such as blood (it is suggested that even an [[Old Deus]] might be fooled by such a thing).\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                * Azriel is the name of an archangel, or demon, in Abrahamic religions, in which it was the archangel of death. It may be the reason for she have a horn on her head.\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Fl\u00fcgel]]\n                [[Category:Article stubs]]",

In the story she seeks to understand the human [heart] and was found by [[Riku]].\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                She looks like a young human but with several differences, being two tails coming out from her back and other machine like features protruding from around her body. She bears many similarities with [[Shiro]]. During her time with humans other than Riku, she wore a robe to cover the mechanical parts on her body, including the piece on her head. However, the tail was uncoverable (as it was her power source) Riku decided to go calling it equipment.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                Her behavior is similar to that of a stereotypical artificial intelligence. She can absorb and process data and intelligence very quickly and act in the appropriate manner, a unique characteristic of her race. However, she seems to have difficulty in comprehending emotions and desires, otherwise characterized by her as the [heart]. Over time spent with Riku, she seems to have started to develop her own [heart]. Her expressions and feelings became more vivid over time.\n\n                After setting her personality to mimic that of a \"shy [[Imanity]] survivor\" and spending a year around Riku's colony, she is unable to reset her personality back to the default monotonous mannerisms of the Ex-machina, stating that she is \"stuck\" in that mode.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Like other Ex-machina, she is able to assess a situation and react accordingly at blazing speeds. An example is when playing chess with Riku, she was able to record any new moves, assess the situation, and proceed correspondingly when presented with the same position in the future.\n\n                Although she took on the appearance of a young Imanity girl, she is incredibly strong to the point of nonchalantly cutting apart a boulder, ripping out a few iron plates, and lift a large metal door ten times her height over her head (to Riku's horror) in a destroyed [[Elf|Elven]] library. She is also incredibly fast as seen when she was able to travel with Riku on her back from the colony to the destroyed Elf city in half a day when traveling by horseback would have taken five days (without the use of magic, in which case it would have taken several minutes according to her).\n\n                Of the Ex Machina, she is one of the Pr\u00fcfer, so she is particularly good at analysis. Despite this analysis of the [heart] took much time.\n\n                She does not require sleep nor any need to eat as she utilizes two live cables to connect to the Elemental Gallery for her power source.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                The Ex-machina are a hive mind unit, however Shuvi was excommunicated from the unit due to various system and logic errors. Therefore, Shuvi was unable to access any of the 27451 artificial weapons stored in the Ex-machinas' linked arsenal until shortly before her death.\n\n                As she was robot and not a human, she was not very good at reading other's minds.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *When Riku asks for the Ex-machina's name, she replies '\u00dcc207Pr4f57t9', to which Riku immediately responds by asking her for a more human name. Her first choice is 'Schwarzer' meaning black in German, which interestingly contrasts with Shiro's name meaning white in Japanese. Eventually, they both settle with the name 'Shuvi'.\n                * 'Schwarzer', as a noun, actually means 'Black One'. Ending with '-er' it would only be used for male beings, since the correct term for a female being would be 'Schwarze'. The actual word for black would be 'Schwarz'.\n\n                == Death ==\n                Shuvi had gone out alone despite Riku trying to prevent her. She was killed in a skirmish with Jibril, who sought to collect her head as a trophy, as the Ex-Machina have become one of the [Rare 5]. Jibril was unable to get her head in the end as she used Air Strike on Shuvi, and she was compelety obliterated. However, she was able to protect the ring she got from Riku using magic. She finally understood the meaning of love in her last moments before death.[[Category:Exmachina]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Female]]",

Despite her young physical appearance, she is actually around 52 years old.\n\n                It is subsequently revealed that Chlammy is actually her family's slave. Despite this, they hold a close relationship between each other. She even begs [[Sora]] to restore Chlammy's memories after the latter won them in a game. Believing that Sora's going to fulfill his words to unite all races, she now works with Chlammy to claim the leadership of Elves as she cares more about Chlammy than her own race.\n                ==Appearance==\n                An elf with long blonde hair, pointy ears and a rather large bust. Her pupils are shaped similar to those of [[Jibril]]'s, cross-like in shape, but more similar to a clover.\n                ==Personality==\n                She greatly cares for Chlammy, even risking her life for her during the Reversi game. Despite having pride as an elf, she is willing to swallow it for the sake of Chlammy. While usually smiling and with a soft voice, she can get serious when the situation calls for it.\n                ==Strengths==\n                She is a hex caster (able to cast and maintain up to six spells at once), a very rare capability that only an extraordinary few possess. However, to protect and aid Chlammy, she hid her magical prowess from the rest of the elves, resulting in them believing Fiel to be a poor magician and a disgrace to the Nirvalen name.\u00a0\n\n                She is also a very smart person. As stated by Sora, Fiel was able to grasp Sora's true intentions without the use of magic.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n                She is very protective of Chlammy and would go to great lengths to keep her safe. This could prove to be a possible extortion factor if Chlammy was ever to be threatened or taken hostage.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                She shara her voice actress with  Tiffania Westwood from Zero no Tsukaima.

It is unknown whether they are physical pathways throughout the body, or metaphysical pathways of energy, like chakra points in Hindu lore. However, the highest level\u00a0Exceed don't actually posses physical form, so it can be assumed that they are non-physical. It is unknown if they can be bet in a game.\n\n                ==Sensing==\n                The use of magic is undetectable to those without the ability to use magic themselves, however, its use causes the eyes of the user to glow in a fashion similar to [[Sora]]'s eyes when he grins slyly.\n                [[Category:Terminology]]",

However, due to the implementation of the [[Ten Pledges]], they have to either let their victims agree to give them his/her soul essence or to play a game that involves the victim's soul essence as the winning prize or is incorporated into the game which, as [[Sora]] notes and [[Plum]] meekly confirms, may lead to many H-games involving a Dhampir and his/her victim.\n\n                Sora presumes after the information gained from Jibril that the Dhampir are a form of succubi and not pure vampires as they are capable of feeding on soul essence from bodily fluids other than blood, although the levels of soul essence are less in other bodily fluids compared to blood with the semen of men containing the highest amount and sweat containing the least.\n\n                It is revealed in [[volume 4]] that while all body fluids can be used to continue their life, they can only increase their power and growth with the consumption of blood. As such, the Dhampirs can only mature to adulthood by the act of blood consumption through biting his/her victim. However, Dhampirs can still live through consuming other body fluids as stated previously but they would be unable to mature thus allowing the possibility of a Dhampir becoming a \"legitimate loli\" as Sora puts it until enough blood is consumed.\n\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Dhampirs have the capability to use magic with their strongest type being cognitive manipulation (ability to manipulate perception of others and themselves). However, the strength of their spells depend on the species from which they gathered soul essence from (preferably blood considering the high concentration of soul essence in it). A higher affinity species' soul essence results in stronger magical abilties. According to volume 4, if a Dhampir acquired [[Elf|Elven]] blood, her/his powers would make for a very powerful assassin. However, Dhampirs can't acquire soul essence beyond the seventh ranked elves as the quality and concentration of any soul essence above the elves would result in the Dhampirs evaporating.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                Sunlight is considered lethal to Dhampirs, similar to vampires. As a result, Dhampirs are most active at night or live in places hidden from the sun's rays such as Oceando. In worst case scenarios the Dhampir shield themselves from the sun's rays using magic but this usually requires a large constant supply of energy to maintain (which is rather difficult considering the pledges limit their options of attaining soul essence from people for said energy). Therefore, Dhampirs seek shaded areas in order to lessen the amount of sunlight thereby requiring less energy to maintain the spell.\n\n                In addition, Dhampirs can also spread this sunlight lethality to their victims. If bitten, Dhampirs are able to gather soul essence from the victim via the victim's blood. However, this also results in mixing some of the Dhampir's soul with the victim's  thus leaving the victim with a mixed soul. Consequently, this creates the lethal susceptibility to sunlight within the victim.\n\n                ==History==\n\n                They are currently living in mutualistic servitude to the [[Seiren]]s of [[Oceando]] after the Seirens won a game that Dhampir designated it as a game of draw.\n\n                If the game ended in a draw, the Seirens bet that the Dhampir males would sustain the Seirens for reproduction purposes while the Dhampir bet to feed on the Seirens, The bet was made in this manner due to the infrequent contact of the Seirens with direct sunlight.\n\n                The bet entailed that the males of the Dhampir would regularly consume Seiren blood for sustenance and maturation while allowing the queen of the Seirens to consume their soul essence so she may reproduce killing the male in the process.\n\n                The females of the Dhampir have limited blood feeding at a young age while elder females must venture into the outer world to find males with which to consume their blood to allow them to mature to adult hood so they may reproduce. They also consume other bodily fluids for sustenance often resulting in H-games with males of other races.\n\n                There is currently only [[Plum|one young Male]] left of the Dhampir race, meaning that as a race, when considering the Doomsday clock scenario, they are only 5 seconds away from extinction as mentioned by Sora.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                TBE\n\n                {{Exceed}}\n                [[es:Vampiros]]\n                [[Category:Races]]",

This is the skull of the Dragonia that Jibril killed by herself.\n\n                Avant Heim was a former protege of the [[Old Deus]] [[Artosh]]. Along with the Flugel, he aided the god of war into nearly seizing the throne of the One True God. However, it was never accomplished as Artosh was slain before they could capture their prize. He could not accept his master's death and has since been attempting to reach the red moon where the [[Lunamana]] reside due to the presence of an Old Deus there which he mistakens as Artosh.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                *Avant Heim could translates into 'First Home', with 'Avant' as 'first' in Romansch, and 'Heim' as 'home' in German.\n                *However, the author has tweeted that 'Avant' comes from modifying the pronunciation of 'abandoned'.\n                [[Category:Location]]\n                [[Category:Phantasma]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Article stubs]]",

He assumed the title after the eternal war which he won after he obtained the [[Star Cup]] before any of the other gods and surpassed their strength despite not participating in the war at all. Tet does not belong to any of [[Exceed|the 16 races]] although the closest affiliation to him would be [[Imanity]]. After both [[Shiro]] and [[Sora]] defeated him in a game of Internet chess, he summoned the siblings to [[Disboard]], under the guise of saving [[Imanity]]. To challenge Tet for the title of the One True God, one must collect all pieces of different chess from 16 races. This means that, under the [[Ten Oaths]], one must defeat or unite all 16 races before being able to play against him.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n                Tet is seen wearing a beret with a brim and a yellow clover on top of it. He has a small red-colored heart below his right eye. His most distinctive features are his eyes, for they are multi-colored. Despite the fact of his eyes being multi-color, his right pupil has a diamond shape and his left a spade shape on it. He wears a large metal earring on his left ear which is shown to be a die, a blue choker and bracelets in both hands with the same color. He wears a red hoodie with a chartreuse shirt and typical blue shorts, accentuating the fact that he is only a boy. Tet appears to have all the symbols of a deck of cards on him (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). He is shown to wear a red sock on his right foot and a red piece of cloth wrapped around his left one.\n                ==Personality==\n                From his introduction when he transported Shiro and Sora to his world, Tet has been shown to be bright and playful like any human boy of his apparent age. From the rules he set up on Disboard he appears to abhor violence and fighting, probably after seeing what the ancient war did to the world. This shows that he may be somewhat benevolent and peaceful. He also mentions that he usually only spectates, rarely interfering. He dislikes the other Old Deus and was shown to have very negative opinion of them. He also thinks of them as boring.\n\n                ==History==\n                A long time ago, [[Riku]] who had a habit of playing chess on his own always imagined the existence of an 'ultimate gamer' sitting right across the chess board, constantly challenging him to another game with a smile. \n\n                During the climax of the Great War, when Riku successfully summoned the Star Cup, he considered himself unworthy of its power and instead prayed for somebody to appear and use the Star Cup to make the world a better place. In his last moments, Riku witnessed the 'ultimate gamer' of his imaginations come to life. The person who stood before him called himself Tet, the final and weakest Old Deus, born from Riku's wish and the overwhelming presence of incredible magic energy. Claiming the Star Cup and becoming the One True God, Tet immediately used his absolute power to repair the damage done to the planet and set forth the Ten Pledges, thus ending the Great War. \n\n                After the end of the Great War, as the Exceed races slowly learned to cope with their new lifestyles, Tet would constantly masquerade as a member of a particular race, infiltrate said race and have as much fun as he could. He also enjoys visiting other worlds and parallel dimensions to learn their games and strategies.\n\n                6000 years later, during one such trip, he came across a pair of siblings who were said to be unbeatable in any game. Intrigued, he challenged them to a game of online chess and, for the first time in his life, lost. Elated over finally meeting a worthy opponent, Tet transported them to the world of Disboard and presented them with the opportunity to challenge him for the throne of One True God.\n\n                Since then, Tet has been constantly monitoring Sora and Shiro with enthusiasm. Not long after Avant Heim joined the Elchean Federation, Tet decided to masquerade as an [[Imanity|Imanitian]] and go play with Sora and Shiro, but ended up fainting on the streets because he hadn't eaten for three days. When [[Hatsuse Izuna|Izuna]] encountered him and fed him some fish, Tet passionately challenged her to various games and recounted the story of Riku and [[Shuvi]] to her.\n\n                ==Abilities==\n                As the One True God and former God of Play, Tet presumably has overwhelming knowledge in all types of games and is very observant to find out cheaters. His abilities are further implied as when Sora and Shiro beat him in a game of chess and they talked in public (light novel) the Imanity were shocked of how their new king beat the One True God in a game of chess. He can also change his appearance at will.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n                As the One True God, he can a plethora of unknown powers, with the definitive ones being teleportation and levitation. He can also be assumed to possess vast amount of Magical Power, being most likely the being with the strongest affinity for magic in Disboard. [[Jibril]] had once stated that even the [[Old Deus]] would have trouble summoning a being from another world, and yet Tet has been able to keep two in [[Disboard]] for a prolonged period of time with no ill effects.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n                As of the moment, he does not have any discernible weaknesses. While he has been beaten by [[Shiro]] and [[Sora]] in a game of online chess, that is the only time when he has been shown to lose, and even then, he pushed them to their limits.\n\n                Before gaining the Star Cup, he was known as the weakest of the Old Deus and was only bought to life by the wishes of Riku.\n\n                ==Character==\n                To be added.\n\n                ==Quotes ==\n                :''(to his World) You creatures who have fought with strength, violence, blood and death, who built a tower of corpses that rises to the sky and call yourselves wise, tell me this: What is the difference between you and the dumb beasts? {{nihongo|\u3082\u3057\u5f37\u3055\u3001\u66b4\u529b\u3001\u8840\u3068\u6b7b\u3068\u6226\u3063\u305f\u306e\u751f\u304d\u7269\u3001  \u8ab0\u304c\u3001\u5929\u306b\u4e0a\u6607\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u304c\u8ce2\u3044\u547c\u3076\u6b7b\u4f53\u306e\u5854\u3092\u5efa\u3066  \u79c1\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3092\u8a00\u3046\uff1a\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3068\u30c0\u30e0\u7363\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f|Moshi tsuyo-sa, b\u014dryoku, chi to shi to tatakatta no ikimono, Dare ga, ten ni j\u014dsh\u014d shi, jibun ga kashikoi yobu shitai no t\u014d o tate Watashi ni kore o iu: Anata to damu-j\u016b no chigai wa nanidesu ka?}}''\n                :\n                :''(to Disboard)'' ''From this piece of Heaven, I command that there will be no plundering or bloodshed.''\n                :''-First law stated by Tet (Volume 1 chapter 1 part 1)''\n\n                == Trivia ==\n                * It is interesting to note that Tet's name is also the 9th letter of the Hebrew alphabet (\"\u05d8\" in Hebrew). Although it cannot be confirmed at this point, Tet's name (\"\u30c6\u30c8\" in Japanese\" could be a reference/abbreviation to \"Tetragrammaton,\" (\"\u30c6\u30c8\u30e9\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30c8\u30f3\" in Japanese) which would explain why he is the sole god in the series.\n                * In Volume 6 it is shown that Tet was the imaginary friend of [[Riku]] that played with him when he was lonely. He was brought to life through prayer and belief to obtain the Star Grail and put an end to the Great War when Riku was unable to due to \"not being worthy\" in his deformed, dying body and physically being unable to reach it due to both arms falling off.\n\n                ==Images==\n                <gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\">\n                Tet Character Info.png\n                Icon-teto.png\n                Tet.jpg\n                The One True God.jpg\n                </gallery>\n\n                [[pl:Tet]]\n                [[es:Tet]]\n                [[fr:Tet]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:God]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Pages to improve on]]",

Meanwhile... [[Steph]] is just being Steph. All hope seems lost when Shiro is shot by Izuna and put under her control. After Izuna discovers that she was tricked by Shiro and found herself in a dire situation, she finally started enjoying a game for the first time in her life.

Meanwhile. [[Steph]] tries desperately to beat them in games, only to end up defeated and humiliated.

Sora let these family members do as they please, and contemplated if they would forgive the ministers who idiotically wagered their family's lives.\u00a0<ref name=\"a\">Volume 2: Chapter 2, Part 2</ref>\n                *When the siblings ran off, Steph's leash was not tied to a pole, but left on the ground.<ref name=\"a\" />\n                *The random game matches in between the two guessing games did not occur, so Steph was not stripped of clothes as much or bespectacled, and Shiro did not have as many extra items to wear.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n                *The episode title's katakana has a different meaning from its kanji. The katakana (\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc) reads 'weak square', while the kanji (\u99d2\u4e26\u3079) means 'arranging the pieces' i.e. 'setting the board'.\n                *A \"weak square\" is a chess term. A square is weak when it is controlled by your opponent and you have little or no chance of regaining control due to a lack of pieces which can effectively fight for that square.<ref>http://www.chess.com/article/view/what-are-quotweak-squaresquot</ref>\n                *There is a clear parody of the movie [[wikipedia:Castle in the Sky|Castle in the Sky]]. The main characters are dressed up very similarly to Castle's, they mention Laputa, and say [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/balse Barusu] (censored) as they hold hands,  the word of destruction spoken together by Pazu and Sheeta in the climax of the film.\n                *Music from [[wikipedia:Mario Party|Mario Party]] is played while Sora is explaining probabilities with cards.\n                *This is the first episode which the [[former king of Imanity]] shows his face. He greatly resembles a [[wikipedia:King (playing card)|King poker card]].\n                *In the post-credits scene, Steph reverts to only having her panties taken away by Shiro and keeps her other clothes. This is probably for consistency in the events that would happen in [[Materialization Shiritori]], as her other clothes were never taken away in the light novel, and the fact that her clothes could not be returned to her under the [[Ten Oaths]]. Shiro also reverts to only wearing Steph's panties on her head.\n                * When Stephanie Dola is complaining about the lack of activity as king and queen of Sora and Shiro, they reply to her that the \"Blanks\" won't work by nature. The way they explain it is similar to the way Simon (of the anime Gurren Lagann Tengen Toppa) explains to the main antagonist the potential of the mankind.\n\n                ==Credits==\n                *'''Screenplay:'''\u00a0[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=25380 Aoshima Takashi] ([[wikipedia:ja:\u3042\u304a\u3057\u307e\u305f\u304b\u3057|\u3042\u304a\u3057\u307e\u305f\u304b\u3057]])\n                *'''Storyboard:''' Sayama Kiyoko ([[wikipedia:ja:\u4f50\u5c71\u8056\u5b50|\u4f50\u5c71\u8056\u5b50]]).\n                *'''Director:''' Sasaki Sumito (\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u7d14\u4eba) and Watanabe Kotono (\u6e21\u9089\u3053\u3068\u4e43)\n                *'''Animation director:''' Ichino Maria (\u5e02\u91ce\u307e\u308a\u3042) and Nagayoshi Takashi (\u6c38\u5409\u9686\u5fd7)\n                ==References==\n                <references />\n\n                [[pl:Odcinek 5]]\n                [[es:Episodio 5]]\n                [[Category:Episodes]]\n                [[Category:Anime]]",

It is later revealed that while he really isn't good at games, he understood this and was trying his best to find out other races' winning secrets, and creating chances for the Imanity.

    Acting half out of playfulness, a god brought us to a world atop a game board:\n                No, no, no game, no life!\n                So we toss away a lukewarm sense of peace,\n                To carve our part out of the steps of glory.\n\n                Reflected in our eyes is a fate of absolute victory.\n                Everything is going as planned;\n                We\u2019ll change everything with an untainted blank space.\n\n                We are maverick; we don\u2019t need a savior!\n                No matter how unfair the odds,\n                All we can do is win.\n                Our strategy and talent render us undefeated.\n                It\u2019s time to have fun with these reborn lives,\n                Only believing in ourselves.\n\n                There\u2019s no opponent stronger than the darkness lurking in your heart,\n                And as long as you don\u2019t yield to it, you\u2019ll be impossible to defeat.\n\n                Don\u2019t kill your pride with superficiality just to put yourself at ease:\n                No, no, no sense of life!\n                Kick aside all the savage noise,\n                And raise the purest cry ever heard.\n\n                The choice to fight is surely not a mistake,\n                The feedback we feel tells us so.\n                Even if we lose everything, we\u2019ll win this round.\n\n                We are maverick; we don\u2019t need common sense!\n                If we were to face front and march straight ahead,\n                All that would be waiting for us is boredom.\n                Taking orders is lame, so we\u2019ll take a challenge instead,\n                Using our reborn lives as pawns,\n                As we follow our own joined paths to their end.\n\n                I won\u2019t lose my way; I\u2019m the chosen one,\n                Even if it\u2019s nothing more than blatant pride.\n                \u2018Cause I only know one way,\n                Of fighting my way through with dignity.\n\n                We are maverick; we don\u2019t need a savior!\n                No matter how unfair the odds,\n                All we can do is win.\n                Our strategy and talent render us undefeated.\n                It\u2019s time to have fun with these reborn lives,\n                Taking the world in our hands with a smile.\n\n                We are maverick; the strongest of maverick gamers.\n                A blank space can become anything,\n                And we only believe in ourselves.\n

She is the main female protagonist of ''[[No Game, No Life]] ''and the calm and calculative half of the siblings. Sora's dad remarried thus making Shiro and Sora only step-siblings.<ref>Volume 2: Chapter 6, Page 1</ref>\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                Shiro is a pale-skinned girl with long, messy white hair with a pale blue, purple, pink, green, and yellow tint and large, passive golden/yellow-red eyes. She is rather slim and about average height (for an eleven year old). She often wears a purple sailor uniform which seems to be very loose on her, along with thigh high stockings.\n\n                ==Personality==\n                Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems, but has difficulty understanding emotions or behaviour, relying on Sora to help her defeat beings with emotions such as [[Tet]] in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all on her face and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short terse sentences and in a third-person perspective.\n\n                Shiro is a master of Chess, and has won every chess game that she has played. She can speak 18 languages and learns [[Imanity-go|Imanity's language]] in 15 minutes (while Sora needed one hour). She is also excellent with games and, along with her brother, is the best in more than 280 games.\n\n                She is shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor, and displays signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex. She is also not above teasing him about his mildly perverse tendencies.\n\n                Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of needing him by her side at all times to be comfortable. If Shiro is separated from Sora by so much as a closed door, she becomes almost catatonic until he returns to her. This can generate problems as when Shiro bathes; she does not want Sora to see her naked yet she can't be separated from him far enough to not be seen. This can be resolved with the presence of steam to cloud their view enough. However, Shiro also generally dislikes bathing as it stiffens her hair, although this was resolved by the Spiritwater Blend shampoo from [[Jibril]].\n\n                Shiro also has a slightly sadistic side to her, which she usually keeps hidden. This is shown evident when she forces [[Plum]] to lick the sweat off her feet in order for him to regain energy. Although Plum does not think too badly of it, Sora still can't help but be shocked every time he sees his sister act that way.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                Shiro has shown to be a genius with an almost supernatural intelligence, with incredible scientific, calculation and simulation abilities, and like her brother she possesses eidetic memory able to learn and recall vast amount of information quickly and accurately. Sora has stated that she has beaten a Chess program written to beat a grandmaster twenty times in a row, and she herself has stated that chess is no different from Tic-Tac-Toe. It has also been stated by her brother that she fluently speaks 18 languages, and learned to read Imanity in 15 minutes. She is also incredibly skilled in First Person Shooters due to her ability to predict the movements and bullet trajectories of her opponents.\n\n                ==Weaknesses==\n\n                While a genius, Shiro has trouble dealing with the human aspects of games, reading human opponents and predicting their moves. A human player doing something unpredictable can unsettle and confuse her, and she relies on Sora to tell her when a human opponent is leading her into a trap, seen in their chess game with Tet.\n\n                Her other weakness is her reliance on Sora. She must be within range of sight and/or sound to Sora or else she'll fall into an almost catatonic state.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                *Shiro means white in Japanese, possibly a reference to her albino appearance\n                *Shiro and Sora's surname was said to be \"Nai\" by the author.<ref>Translated from [https://twitter.com/yuukamiya68/statuses/443532417517641729 Twitter post by author]</ref> This can be interpreted that their surname is literally Nai or that they have no surname, as {{nihongo|Nai|\u306a\u3044}} in Japanese means none (which is likely in reference to [[\u300e\u3000\u3000\u300f]]).\n                *Shiro's voice actor sang the first ending song, \"[[Oraci\u00f3n]].\"\n                *Shiro's glare made even Jibril tremble when her plan to persuade Sora was interrupted.\n                *Her name is pronounced similar to Zero, which becomes more clear when her name is spelled in English/Imanity (Siro) (\"Si\" is another way to romanize \"Shi\")\n\n                ==Images==\n                <gallery type=\"slideshow\" widths=\"600\" position=\"center\">\n                Shiro Character Info.png|Shiro's anime character info\n                NGNL_Volume_1_cover_page.jpg|Shiro as the cover girl of [[Volume 1]]\n                </gallery>\n\n                ==References==\n                <references />\n\n                [[pl:Shiro]]\n                [[es:Shiro]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]\n                [[Category:Female]]\n                [[Category:Imanity]]\n                [[Category:Human]]",

While they only briefly appear in the light novel and the manga adaptation, they are seen slightly more in the anime adaptation.\n\n                In [[Episode 01|episode 1]], as they have to comply with the [[Ten Pledges]], they can only steal from others by winning a game. The thieves assumed the siblings were like their usual victims from the countryside who were not knowledgeable about games and challenged them to a game, where each side had bet all their belongings. They were defeated swiftly, thus forced to explain the new world to the siblings. One of them asked Sora to at least leave them with pants to cover themselves, but was refused, thus they were left in only their underwear. They briefly appeared in [[Episode 03|episode 3]] as faraway spectators of the siblings' coronation speech, shown in their underwear and wearing additional leaves.\n\n                ==Adaption notes==\n                * While there are three thieves in the series' anime adaptation, there are more than a dozen of them in its manga adaptation.\n                ==References==\n\n                <references />\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Male]]\n                [[Category:Side characters]]\n                [[Category:Imanity]]",

After [[Sora]] and [[Shiro]] forced the werebeasts to join the [[Elchea Federation]], Izuna was directed by [[Miko]] to follow and learn from them. Sora and [[Shiro]] have a habit of petting her fur (tail) yet she seems to enjoy it (much to the chagrin of her [[Hatsuse Ino|grandfather]]). [[Steph]] has noted that she actually shares similarities to Sora and Shiro, such as lacking common sense, being arrogant towards others, and being extremely smart and competent at gaming.\n\n                ==Appearance==\n\n                Similar to other werebeasts, Izuna has a combination of animal and human traits, with her having fox-like ears and a fluffy tail. She has dark purple hair and chestnut eyes (black hair and black eyes in the light novel). Her pupils are vertically slitted, similar to those of a cat.\n\n                When Izuna uses her \"Blood Destruction\" ability, she grows a longer tail, and all fur from her body turns red. She also has a red symbol on her forehead.\n\n                ==Personality==\n\n                She is adored by Sora and Shiro for being extremely cute, and they love petting her fur. Likewise, Izuna seems to share the same fondness towards them and enjoys being petted. She even mentions once that she prefers the siblings' petting techniques over her grandfather, Hatsuse Ino. She is still learning the Imanity language, and has a habit of saying \"Desu\" after everything in an attempt to make it sound polite.\n\n                She mostly exhibits an innocent personality pertaining to her age yet is very competent at playing games to the point of representing the werebeasts in national games against other races.\n\n                ==Strengths==\n\n                She possesses all the incredible physical abilities found in all werebeasts as well as the rare \"kekkai\" ability (aka 'Blood Destruction') found in a select few werebeast individuals (although she is only able to remain in that form for only a few seconds before she risks death).\n\n                She has the ability to learn at an amazing rate if what she is learning is game-related as in the case of learning to read the Imanity language from a game book overnight while [[Steph]] slept (still limited in speaking the language however).\n\n                ==Weakness==\n\n                Despite being considered \"mature\" among the Werebeasts at the age of eight, she is still naive in adult-related subjects.\n\n                ==Trivia==\n\n                TBE\n\n                [[pl:Izuna Hatsuse]]\n                [[es:Izuna Hatsuse]]\n                [[Category:Characters]]\n                [[Category:Werebeast]]\n                [[Category:Female]]\n                [[Category:Main characters]]",
