[[Image:Weird Al Yankovic.jpg|thumb|Weird Al Himself]]
'''&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic''', the undisputed king of pop culture parody, (born October 23, 1959) has sold more comedy recordings than any other artist in history. In a career spanning nearly three decades, he has amassed 30 Gold and Platinum albums, 7 Gold and Platinum-certified home videos and 3 Grammy Awards (with 11 nominations).

==In The Beginning==
[[Image:ClassicAl.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;Classic Al&quot; Before having eye surgery and changing his hair]]
The singer-songwriter's first real brush with fame came in 1979 when he recorded &quot;{{S|My Bologna}}&quot; (a spoof of {{W|The Knack}}'s &quot;{{W|My Sharona}}&quot;) in the bathroom across the hall from his college campus radio station where he had a weekly DJ shift. A devoteé of musical satirists {{W|Spike Jones}}, {{W|Tom Lehrer}}, {{W|Allan Sherman}}, and {{W|Stan Freberg}}, Yankovic's budding career took off when the song became a sensation on the nationally syndicated &quot;[[Dr. Demento Show]].&quot; Just a few years later, Al landed his first recording contract and has since created an extraordinary legacy of music and ground-breaking videos, including hits like &quot;{{S|Eat It}},&quot; &quot;{{S|Like A Surgeon}},&quot; &quot;{{S|Amish Paradise}}&quot; and &quot;{{S|White and Nerdy}}.&quot;

==Videos==
An accomplished director, Al has helmed many of his own award-winning music videos as well as clips for {{W|Ben Folds}}, {{W|Jeff Foxworthy}}, {{W|The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion}}, {{W|Hanson}}, and {{W|The Black Crowes}}. His video for &quot;{{S|Smells Like Nirvana}},&quot; nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in 1992, was chosen by {{W|Rolling Stone}} as one of the &quot;Top 100 Music Videos Of All Time.&quot; Al also created the critically acclaimed title sequence for the {{W|Leslie Nielsen}} feature film &quot;{{S|Spy Hard}}.&quot;

==Television==
[[File:UHF.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Making a successful transformation from pop music satirist to multimedia star, Al created his own television specials for {{W|MTV}} (&quot;[[AL-TV]]&quot;), {{W|Showtime}} and the {{W|Disney Channel}}, among others. His feature film &quot;[[UHF (film)|UHF]]&quot; (1989) became an instant Top Ten best-selling [[DVDs|DVD]] upon its release in 2002, and his CBS network series &quot;[[The Weird Al Show]]&quot; reached cult-classic status and was released on DVD earlier this year. Al has been featured on numerous TV shows and specials, and his profile on {{W|VH-1}}'s &quot;{{W|Behind the Music}}&quot; remains one of the most popular installments in the history of the series.

==Straight Outta Lynwood==
[[File:Lynwood.jpg|thumb|200px|Album Cover]]
Yankovic's 12th studio album {{Al|Straight Outta Lynwood}} (Way Moby/Volcano) is a DualDisc release brimming with special features. The DVD side contains six brand new Weird Al music videos produced by some of the world's top animators, including Academy Award-nominated filmmaker {{W|Bill Plympton}}, &quot;{{W|Ren &amp; Stimpy}}&quot; creator {{W|John Kricfalusi}}, acclaimed media artist {{W|Jim Blashfield}}, the creative team behind {{W|Cartoon Network}}'s {{W|Adult Swim}} show &quot;{{W|Robot Chicken}}&quot; and popular Internet animators {{W|Thomas Lee}} and {{W|David C. Lovelace}}. The package also features a 9-minute behind-the-scenes documentary, as well as PCM Stereo, 5.1 Surround Sound and karaoke/instrumental versions of the entire album.

The centerpiece of Straight Outta Lynwood is &quot;{{S|White and Nerdy}},&quot; a parody of {{W|Chamillionaire}}'s No. 1 smash hit &quot;{{W|Ridin'}}.&quot; Al directed the highly-acclaimed video clip, which features hilarious cameos by {{W|Donny Osmond}}, {{W|Seth Green}}, {{W|Judy Tenuta}} and {{W|Mad TV}}'s {{W|Keegan-Michael Keys}} and {{W|Jordan Peele}}. The &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot; video went straight into heavy rotation on VH-1 (debuting at #5 in their Top 20 Countdown) and quickly racked up a few million hits on [[YouTube]].

Straight Outta Lynwood also features parodies of {{W|Green Day}} (&quot;{{S|Canadian Idiot}}&quot;), {{W|Usher}} (&quot;{{S|Confessions Part III}}&quot;), {{W|Taylor Hicks}} (&quot;{{S|Do I Creep You Out}}&quot;) and {{W|R. Kelly}} (the 11-minute epic &quot;{{S|Trapped in the Drive-Thru}}&quot;), as well as the now-traditional [[:Category:Polka|polka]] medley (&quot;{{S|Polkarama!}}&quot;), which this time includes accordion-fueled renditions of hits by such artists as {{W|50 Cent}}, {{W|The Black Eyed Peas}}, {{W|Snoop Dogg}}, {{W|Coldplay}}, {{W|Weezer}}, {{W|Pussycat Dolls}}, and {{W|Kanye West}}.

&quot;{{S|Don't Download This Song}},&quot; the first song and video released from the album, is a tongue-in-cheek look at the hot-button issue of mp3 piracy, set to original music inspired by the celebrity-driven charity benefit songs from the ‘80s. The song was ironically offered as a free download on [http://www.weirdal.com Al's web site] and [http://www.myspace.com/weirdal MySpace page] , and quickly became a viral worldwide hit. Other original compositions on the album include an homage to both {{W|Brian Wilson}} and internal organs (&quot;{{S|Pancreas}}&quot;), an ode to computer-based paranoia (&quot;{{S|Virus Alert}}&quot;), a headbanger about frivolous lawsuits (&quot;{{S|I'll Sue Ya}}&quot;), an anthem for the relationship-impaired (&quot;{{S|Close But No Cigar}}&quot;) and a cheery ditty about the most festive time of the year (&quot;{{S|Weasel Stomping Day}}&quot;).

Straight Outta Lynwood debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts, making it Al's highest charting album to date until [[Alpocalypse]].

The bad news is that occasionally a ''Wiki Troll'' will deface a page.  The good news is that any page can be reverted back to a previous version:

''Simply click &quot;history&quot; at the top of the page you wish to roll back. Then click on the time and date of the archived version you want to revert back to. The page will appear with the version indicated at the top of the page, just underneath the page title. Next, click &quot;edit&quot; at the top of the page. Add a note in the Summary box that you are reverting the page because of a troll, and then click &quot;Save page&quot;.''

&lt;pre&gt;
I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin' old
Vanilla just leaves me cold

There's just one flavor good enough for me, yah me
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon
I know what I need

Baby, I love rocky road
So weren't you gonna buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road
So have another triple scoop with me, ow

They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same
All the soda jerkers know my name
When their supple is gone
Then I'll be movin' on

But I'll be back on Monday afternoon, you'll see
Another truck load's comin' in for me, all for me
I'm singin'

I love rocky road
So weren't you gonna buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road
So have another triple scoop with me, ow

(oh, make it talk)

When I'm all alone, I just grab myself a cone
And if I get fat and loose my teeth that's fine with me
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key
Sing it

I love rocky road
So weren't you gonna buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road
So have another triple scoop with me

I love rocky road
So weren't you gonna buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road
So have another triple scoop with&lt;/pre&gt;

== Misattribution and imitators ==
[http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm Yankovic's official website] has the following note:

::''Unfortunately, there are a lot of song parodies floating around the Internet being attributed to Al which are in fact done by somebody else. &quot;Star Wars Cantina,&quot; &quot;Windows 95 Sucks,&quot; &quot;Living La Vida Yoda,&quot; &quot;Combo No. 5,&quot; &quot;What If God Smoked Cannabis,&quot; &quot;He Got The Wrong Foot Amputated&quot; (the list goes on and on ... some of the titles are unprintable in a family-friendly web site) - these songs are NOT by Al. If you want to verify whether or not a song is actually by Al, check the [http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm Catalogue] page.''

Because Yankovic is arguably the most successful parody artist, songs posted to [[file sharing]] networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter.  Much to the disdain of Yankovic, this includes songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205|title=&quot;Ask Al&quot; Q&amp;As for October 2, 2005|accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic cites these misattributions as &quot;his real beef with [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] sites:&quot;
{{quote|If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with.  That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image – and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just … well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Don't_Download_This_Song&quot; /&gt;}}
    
A list of songs ''not'' by Yankovic can be found at [http://www.com-www.com/weirdal/notbyal.html The Not Al List]. Alternatively, a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website's [http://www.weirdal.com/rcdgdate.htm Recording Dates Page].

Hey, The thing. Can you make me a sysop or unprotect the main page? Thanks. --[[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] 21:57, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

As a Weird Al fan, It will be an honor to join this new wiki! [[User:E.L. Cool|E.L. Cool]] 17:22, 26 January 2006 (UTC)


== Did you? ==

Did you edit the css so that it mentions guestbooks everywhere? That's pretty cool! {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 18:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
:Yea. &amp;mdash;{{User:The thing/sig}} 20:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
::That's so cool! {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 20:15, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

== Copyright ==

Hey I made the [[Weird Al Wiki:Copyrights|copyright page at the bottom of the editing screen]]! I've asked two people to translate it, so we may be able to have it in different languages. It's most likely easier for someone to understand it in their native language, so why not try? People may become users speaking another language as their first. I dunno... {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 02:43, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

==New Wiki==

Sorry to see you are moving on, is there a problem I can help with? It's not really appropriate to use the site mediawiki messages to advertise your new site, so I've removed this. I've left the main page link though so anyone who wants to see the new Wiki can do. Are you resigning from this wiki? Or just running the two at the same time? -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 19:35, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:I'll still be here. But I'll also be at the new one. &amp;mdash;{{User:The thing/sig}} 21:09, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

::I'm still confused. Why two wikis on the same subject? You will be diluting your user-base this way and you may end up with two unsuccessful wikis rather than one successful one. Are there going to be differences between the two? How do you think this will work? -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 12:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

:::It will be the same just, not on wikicities. &amp;mdash;{{User:The thing/sig}} 23:01, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

::::So why two? -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 09:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

The thing, I don't want to see this wiki go to waste, so I have an idea for you: You wanted a Fanstuff wiki for Weird Al, right? We can't have it on the new wiki, so how about this one? [[User:E.L. Cool|E.L. Cool]] 10:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
:Good idea! Thanks! &amp;mdash;{{User:The thing/sig}} 21:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

== i'll ask again... ==

I still don't have an answer from the question I asked you back then. Still, how do people become sysops? --[[User:The 386|The 386]] 01:10, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
:By using Special:Makesysop. &amp;mdash;{{User:The thing/sig}} 01:13, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Orangey-Bruth ==

Hey! It's me!--[[User:Homsarroks|Homsarroks]] 02:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

==Sitenotice==

I left the site notice for a few days, but it's time for it to go. It really is not appropriate to advertise another Weird Al wiki using the site notice. Please don't replace it. Thanks -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 15:48, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

==Copyright==

Hi, there is a copyright issue that you need to look at, please could you read the [[Weird Al Wiki:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. Thanks -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 15:34, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

==Favicon==

I converted you icon to an .ico file and uploaded - you may need to clear you cache to see it. I had to crop it a little to get it the right size. If it's cropped too close and you want to make another at 16x16 pixels, I can convert that for you too -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 14:52, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
:No this is good. &amp;mdash;{{SUBST:User:The Thing/sig}} 20:38, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
Why did you delete [[Lyrics:The Devil Went Down to Jamaica]]? I'm going to kick your butt. &amp;mdash;[[User:Flatts|Flatts]] 17:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I got the video for Happy Birthday, here is the site-

== Question ==

I'm a Weird Al fan and also use a bunch of wikis...you should be able to figure out the rest :) [[User:Millenian|Millenian]] 22:59, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

An idea: I notice a lot of fans like to imitate Weird Al by doing their own parodies of songs. Perhaps, on this site, could we have something like a &quot;fan fiction&quot; section where fans can post their song parodies for others to see? [[User:Millenian|Millenian]] 03:30, 8 January 2009 (UTC)
:Time for a history lesson: This wikis life story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;A long long time ago in galaxy far away, the weird al wiki started. I made it.
It was getting kind of popular actually.
Then some other people made another one. At a different site.
This wiki became &quot;The Weird Al Fanstuff Wiki&quot;
Then the other wiki died.
This was was shocked back to life.
The fanstuff was deleted. 
And the chocolate factory started working again. Full blast! But no one ever comes in. And no one ever comes out.
okay, wait. Now I'm getting confused with willy wonka...
And now!!!! I'm gunna make it both a fanstuff wiki and a normal wiki.&lt;/pre&gt; The end. '''[[User:The thing|&lt;font color=green&gt;The&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User_talk:The thing|&lt;font color=blue&gt;thing&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/User:The thing|&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Edits&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 21:58, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== New Poll ==

I created a new poll, just change the 1 in {{P/1}} to a two. [[User:Olsonman|Olsonman]] 16:43 AM, Febuary 1, 2009 (UTC)

== Poll Number 4 ==

TT, the new poll is used starting this sunday, I just prepared for it. [[User:Olsonman|Olsonman]] 23:24, February 12, 2009 (UTC)

== Emo Phillips! ==

Hey, The thing! Just replying to your message about Emo Philips in the music video for &quot;It's All About the Pentiums&quot;. He is the guy who &quot;works at a desk with a dumb little placard.&quot; I've been giving lots of infomation on your pages and adding heaps. Your wiki rocks keep up the good work.
This is BarryTB135, by the way.

== A cameo ==

On Weird Al's twitter, it says that he will make an apperance on the movie, 17 Again. [[User:Olsonman|Olsonman]] 23:11 PM, 18 April, 2009 (UTC)

== Genius in France ==

Hey, is it possible to remove the protection from [[Genius In France]]? Nice wiki, btw! [[User:Snicker|Snicker]] 03:08, January 2, 2010 (UTC)

==ipad9 message 1==

Yes, I would like to be sysop :). I won't be making too much edits but I'll do some every few days.

[[User:Ipad9|Ipad9]] ([[User talk:Ipad9|talk]]) 22:25, April 2, 2013 (UTC)

==ipad9 message #2==

I'm thinking of changing the template for albums &amp; singles to [http://mau5.wikia.com/wiki/At_Play_Vol._1_(album) something like this.] It will still have the info it has now, but with even more. What do you think?

By the way I will be offline for about Monday to Thursday.

[[User_Talk:Ipad9|(Talk)]] 23:23, April 19, 2013 (UTC)

==ipad9 Message #3==

Should we change the album pages to look [[Weird Al Wiki:Sandbox| like this?]] I'll try to make a template for singles and possibly compilations that would look a lot like the album infoboxes.

==The other wikia==
When I searched years ago I found nothing so assumed no one had done this yet. Otherwise I wouldn't have bothered making my own. Anyway, no problems just redirecting here. When you click on Wikia and search for Weird Al Yankovic it shows other wikias not related to Weird Al at all appearing before your wikia, despite you having more pages than them. I guess when I searched two and a half years ago, you weren't on the first page of results, so I didn't notice you.

This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
Couldn't think of any lyrics
No, I never wrote the lyrics
So I'll just sing any old lyrics
That come to mind, child
You really need words
Whole lotta rhyming words
You gotta rhyme so many words, mm...
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right, child

This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long

I know that you're probably sore
'Cause I didn't write any more
I just didn't get to complete it
So that's why I gotta repeat it

This song's just six words long (six words long)
This song's just six words long (six words long)

Oh I make a lotta money
They pay me a ton of money
They're payin' me plenty of money
To sing this song, child
I gotta fill time
Three minutes worth of time
Oh, how will I fill so much time? Mm...
I'll throw in a solo, a solo, a solo
A solo, a solo here

This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long
This song's just six words long

This song's got nothing to say
But I'm recording it anyway
I know if I put my mind to it
I know I could find a good rhyme here

Oh, you gotta have-a music
You need really catchy music
This song has got plenty of music
But just six words, child
And so I'll sing 'em over
And over and over and over,
And over and over and over,mm...
And over and over and over,
And over and over and over again

&lt;pre&gt;
I, man, am regal - a German am I
Never odd or even
If I had a hi-fi
Madam, I'm Adam
Too hot to hoot
No lemons, no melon
Too bad I hid a boot
Lisa Bonet ate no basil
Warsaw was raw
Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Rise to vote, sir
Do geese see God?
&quot;Do nine men interpret?&quot; &quot;Nine men,&quot; I nod
Rats live on no evil star
Won't lovers revolt now?
Race fast, safe car
Pa's a sap
Ma is as selfless as I am
May a moody baby doom a yam?

Ah, Satan sees Natasha
No devil lived on
Lonely Tylenol
Not a banana baton
No &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Nixon&quot;
O, stone, be not so
O Geronimo, no minor ego
&quot;Naomi,&quot; I moan
&quot;A Toyota's a Toyota&quot;
A dog, a panic in a pagoda

Oh no! Don Ho!
Nurse, I spy gypsies - run!
Senile felines
Now I see bees I won
UFO tofu
We panic in a pew
Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo
God! A red nugget! A fat egg under a dog!
Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog!

&lt;pre&gt;
Someday I'm gonna pack up
And then I'm goin' back up
To that place where sentimental feelings arouse

Where the grass is so green
And the air is so clean
That when the wind is right you can even smell the cows

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

If you're new in town
Then you'll wanna look around
But you don't know where to begin
Well, there's Bubble Gum Alley
And the local car rally
Not to mention the toilets at Madonna Inn

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

It's not much of a hassle
To drive up to Hearst's Castle
And it's not too far from Pismo Beach or Morro Rock

You can visit downtown at your leisure
Because for your shopping pleasure
The stores never close down until five o'clock

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down (take me down)
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today
&lt;/pre&gt;

There was a sample page,
The Lyrics were indented
Using single colons!!

For two verses
Without a chorus in between
A single line
should break them


For a chorus
Break twice before proceeding
It's only natural
For a song page


Oh, Sample song
What do you think?
Oh, Sample song
You're turning pink


Also break twice
When starting a new
Verse or something
  (Verse or something)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">Wow. A wiki about Weird Al, my favorite artist. Ok, some things: A good start will be to see [http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page This Might Be A Wiki] formatted their site and take notes. Getting the lyrics is no problem as they are all over the net. Hmm... So many things come in mind. I just ''know'' I'm gonna contribute to this wiki alot! [[User:E.L. Cool|E.L. Cool]] 17:09, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

== Content resources ==

As I'm seeing that I'm the only one right now who add actual, nicly formatted contenet (exept for a few lyrics), I'm guessing that the others just simply don't know where to get information. So here are some great resource sites:

*[[Wikipedia:&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic|The wikipedia article]]: Have a page for every album with full details like those written on [[Album:Poodle Hat]].
*[http://www.yankovic.org/ Yankovic!]: All the lyrics in the albums and out of them, site directories and whats not.
*[http://www.weirdal.com/ Official site]: With the nice, long, informative, [http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm &quot;Ask Al Archive] that dates back to 1994. Just search for a song/album name and gets tons of trivia.
:[[User:E.L. Cool|E.L. Cool]] 05:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
::Very cool, E.L.! We should make a &quot;Resources&quot; page or something... --{{User:Smileyface11945/sig}} 22:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Copyright ==

You say the wiki has been copyrighted. That's a bit misleading. It's licensed under the GFDL, which says it can be modified and copied and used for any purpose, even for profit, provided the license is included.

I'm taking down that line unless anyone has an objection to it.--[[User:Mewrio|Mewrio]] 22:22, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== Double wikis ==

There are two Weird Al wikis. One here, and one at http://weirdalforum.com/wiki/&lt;nowiki&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Which one am I supposed to edit? &amp;ndash; '''[[User:Smiddle|S]]'''[[User talk:Smiddle|middle]] 09:12, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

:I'd suggest this one, but I'm biased. :) See [[w:Why use Wikia?|Why use Wikia?]] for some reasons. You have the advantage of stable hosting at Wikia as well as lots of new features under development (see our new [[w:c:tunes|music magazine]] for example) and single login to all Wikia sites. [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

:: The other wiki has namespaces (Lyrics, Album, Music, Song), though they're uncorrectly capitalized (e.g. Lyrics Talk instead of Lyrics talk). But the namespaces pobably aren't needed. &amp;ndash; '''[[User:Smiddle|S]]'''[[User talk:Smiddle|middle]] 15:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:::The problem with using namespaces is that it decreases the article count ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}) which only counts the main namespace. It also makes it harder to link to pages since you need to use a Lyrics: prefix all the time, and makes it harder to find the content you want since the default search only looks in the main namespace. [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:57, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

 &lt;FireBird&gt; pikastu: shut your yap trap.
 &lt;pikastu&gt; I don't think so
 *** pikastu is now known as _stu.
 &lt;FireBird&gt; I'm sorry, sir.

 &lt;FireBird&gt; I'm sorry, sir.
 &lt;eddddddddddddddd&gt;: at least, ducks might get banned for that
 *** FireBird has been kicked from #hrwiki by _stu: (&quot;Not sorry enough.&quot;)

 * Chmera pokes Every1LovesSteve.

===[[Quote of the Week Character Heads]]===
I used [http://www.flash-decompiler.com/ a Flash Decompiler] to look at the Quote of the Week file, and I found that there are thirty 'character faces' built in to the file. On the suggestion of Stux, I started [[Quote of the Week Character Heads]] for them. Thanks  I do have a .zip file of these pictures (11[[HR:7seconds.swf|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;]] KB), email me if you want it.

===[[Sound Effects]]===
I added some .OGG sounds to this page. 

===[[In Search of the Yello Dello Storyboards]]===
I added most of the pictures to this page.

===[[The King of Town DVD Storyboards]]===
I added the pictures to this page, as well as some formatting.

===[[Hanging Objects]]===
Helped out a bit, still working on it.

==Special Thanks==

&lt;pre&gt;
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain 
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain 
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows... fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine 
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise 
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish Paradise 
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish Paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish Paradise

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and turned the other cheek 
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell 
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree, I really look good in black... fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitive as can be

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish Paradise 
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish Paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish Paradise

Hitchin' up the buggy 
Churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday,
soon I'll raise anodder
Think you're really righteous? 
Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife 
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish Paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish Paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish Paradise

Yuck
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1593">Ridin' in a bus down the boulevard,
And the place was pretty packed.
Couldn't find a seat, so I had to stand,
With the perverts in the back.
It was smellin' like a locker room.
There was junk all over the floor.
We're already packed in like sardines,
But we're stoppin' to pick up more.
Look out!

Another one rides the bus-ah.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
And another comes on,
And another comes on.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
Hey!
He's gonna sit by you.
Another one rides the bus.

There's a suitcase pokin' me in the ribs.
There's an elbow in my ear.
There's a smelly old bum standin' next to me.
Hasn't showered in a year.
Well, I think I'm missin' a contact lens.
I think my wallet's gone.
And I think this bus is stoppin' again,
To let a couple more freaks get on.
Look out!

Another one rides the bus-ah.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
And another comes on,
And another comes on.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
Hey!
He's gonna sit by you.
Another one rides the bus.

Another one rides the bus.
Another one rides the bus--ow!
Another one rides the bus--hey, hey!
Another one rides the bus--hey-y-y-y!

The window doesn't open, and the fan is broke,
And my face is turnin' blue.
I haven't been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see The Who.
Well, I should'a got off a couple miles ago,
But I couldn't get to the door.
There isn't any room for me to breathe.
Now we're gonna pick up more, yeah!

Another one rides the bus-ah.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
And another comes on,
And another comes on.
Another one rides the bus-ah.
Hey!
He's gonna sit by you.
Another one rides the bus.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10524">'''27''' is a number that comes up on a lot of Al's songs and other things. Though some are on purpose, others are just mere coincidence.

&lt;pre&gt;
Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you
The word is out, better treat me right
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right

My zippers bust, my buckles break
I'm too much man for you to take
The pavement cracks when I fall down
I've got more chins than Chinatown

Well, I've never used a phone booth
And I've never seen my toes
When I'm goin' to the movies
I take up seven rows

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
Don'tcha call me pudgy, portly or stout
Just now tell me once again who's fat

When I walk out to get my mail
It measures on the Richter scale
Down at the beach I'm a lucky man
I'm the only one who gets a tan
If I have one more pie a la mode
I'm gonna need my own zip code

When you're only having seconds
I'm having twenty-thirds
When I go to get my shoes shined
I gotta take their word

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, shamu
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And my shadow weighs forty-two pounds
Lemme tell you once again who's fat

If you see me comin' your way
Better give me plenty space
If I tell you that I'm hungry
Then won't you feed my face

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
Woo woo woo, when I sit around the house
I really sit around the house

You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know, you know, you know, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And you know all by myself I'm a crowd
Lemme tell you once again

You know I'm huge, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, you know, hoo
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And the whole world knows I'm fat and I'm proud
Just tell me once again who's fat
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'd like to see this as the Wiki's logo, but for some reason, I can't get it transparent. I'll do some research, maybe there's something I'm not doing right. In the meantime, what do you think of this picture as the Wiki's logo? --[[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] 17:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

==Trivia==
* [[Wikipedia:Krist Novoselic|Krist Novoselic]] of Nirvana said that the band felt they had &quot;made it&quot; after Yankovic recorded this song. [[Wikipedia:Kurt Cobain|Kurt Cobain]] called Yankovic an American pop rock genius in his private journal.
* Dick van Patten makes a cameo in the music video on one of the bleachers. He also appears briefly on &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot;.
* The janitor that appears in the music video is the same one that appears in the clip for “Smells Like Teen Spirit”.
* The album cover is a parody of the album Nevermind, the one with a naked baby swimming with a dollar.
* The cheerleaders are also the same ones that appeared in the original video.

&lt;pre&gt;
What is this song all about?
Can't figure any lyrics out
How do the words to it go?
I wish you'd tell me, I don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know, I don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know...


Now I'm mumblin' and I'm screamin'
And I don't know what I'm singin'
Crank the volume, ears are bleedin'
I still don't know what I'm singin'


We're so loud and incoherent
Boy, this oughta bug your parents
Yeah

It's unintel-ligible
I just can't get it through my skull

It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss
With all these marbles in my mouth
Don't know, don't know, don't know, I don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know...


Well, we don't sound like Madonna
Here we are now, we're Nirvana
Sing distinctly? We don't wanna
Buy our album, we're Nirvana
A garage band from Seattle
Well, it sure beats raisin' cattle
Yeah

''{Gargles melody}''
''{Kazoos}''
''{Tuba}'

And I forgot the next verse
Oh well, I guess it pays to rehearse

The lyric sheet's so hard to find
What are the words? Oh, nevermind

Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no
Don't know, don't know, don't know...


Well, I'm yellin' and we're playin'
But I don't know what I'm sayin'
What's the message I'm conveyin'?
Can you tell me what I'm sayin'?

So have you got some idea?
Didn't think so -- Well, I'll see ya
Sayonara, sayonara
Ayonawa, odinawa
Odinaya, yodinaya
Yaddayadda, yaaahyaaah
Ayaayaaaah! ''{Coughs}''
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
*According to the [http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm FAQ at WeirdAl.com], There wasn't and official video for this album because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Al was actually planning to do a video for “Couch Potato” (his parody of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”). But unfortunately, even though Eminem was okay with Al having the parody on his album, for some strange reason he denied permission for Al to make a music video for the song. Since Al was already in pre-production on the video and also had to put together his AL-TV special and gear up for a 3-month concert tour, he didn’t have the time to switch gears and do a video for a different song. Al did put together a couple of makeshift videos for AL-TV (including one for the song “Bob” which was a dead-on parody of Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” from the Don’t Look Back documentary), but those were low-budget quickies that were intended to be exclusive to the VH1 special.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*When asked to identify the people on the CD cover, Weird Al recognized them as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Well, let’s see… the guy with the poodle on his head would be me. The very pregnant woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin- once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for “The Saga Begins”). UH Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay’s son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for the Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne’s oldest friends. Bermuda’s wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt’s boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*On the cover on the boyscouts shirt is the number '''[[27]]'''.

===Easter eggs===
*Put the disk into your computer. When it pops up hit the space bar to see a picture of Al and his wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2557">Lyrics:

&lt;pre&gt;
I was driving on the freeway in the fast lane
With a rabid wolverine in my underwear
When suddenly a guy behind me in the back seat
Popped right up and cupped his hands across my eyes

I guessed, &quot;Is it Uncle Frank or Cousin Louie?&quot;
&quot;Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?&quot;
&quot;Could it be Bill or Jim or Ed or Bernie or Steve?&quot;
I probably would have kept on guessing
But about that time we crashed into the truck

And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt
Finally I recognize the face of my hibachi dealer
Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me

Everything you know is wrong
Black is white, up is down and short is long
And everything you thought was just so
Important doesn't matter

Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is
Everything you know is wrong

I was walkin' to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams
When I accidentally stepped into an alternate dimension
And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space
Who kinda looked like Jamie Farr

They sucked out my internal organs
And they took some polaroids
And said I was a darn good sport
And as a way of saying thank you
They offered to transport me back to
Any point in history that I would care to go

And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night
So I could pay my phone bill on time
Just then the floating disembodied head of
Colonel Sanders started yelling

Everything you know is wrong
Black is white, up is down and short is long
And everything you thought was just so
Important doesn't matter

Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is
Everything you know is wrong

I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin
When I got a nasty papercut
And, well, to make a long story short
It got infected and I died

So now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter
By the pearly gates
And it's obvious he doesn't like
The Nehru jacket that I'm wearing
He tells me that they've got a dress code

Well, he lets me into heaven anyway
But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine
For all eternity
And every day he runs by screaming

Everything you know is wrong
Black is white, up is down and short is long
And everything you used to think was so important
Doesn't really matter anymore
Because the simple fact remains that

Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is
Everything you know is wrong
Everything you know is wrong
&lt;/pre&gt;

== READ THIS ==
&lt;!--Do not remove this. This is important--&gt;
I have gotten multiple messages on Hotmail saying &quot;If you don't send this to other people, you have to pay for your MSN accounts.&quot; This is '''''UNTRUE'''''. One: not Microsoft protocol. I have seen the real message and it contains no design, which is what Microsoft would do. Two: how would that solve anything? They either tell people about it, or get money from it. It is basically a prank. Just thought you ought to know.

:Who is it from? --{{User:The thing/sig}} 22:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

:1)This is a userpage, but I don't care. This matters. 2) it is from people who believe it, that's why it's important to write about this. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 22:49, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

::What is one person it is from? --{{User:The thing/sig}} 22:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

:::I'm not going to reaveal names. Plus, I delorted it. But uh, when I saw the real message, it from someone like [[HRWiki:credit card|this email]]. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 05:06, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3902">Song: Couch Potato

Running Time: '''4:18'''

Year: '''Originally 2003'''

Album: '''[[Album:Poodle Hat|Poodle Hat]]'''

Parody of:[[Wikipedia:Lose Yourself|Lose Yourself]]''' by '''[[Wikipedia:Eminem|Eminem]]

Lyrics: '''[[Lyrics:Couch Potato|Couch Potato]]'''

Video: '''Cancelled'''

Download/listen: [http://music.msn.com/artist/default.aspx?artist=100720]

==Trivia==
* This is one of the many [[&quot;Weird Al&quot;]] songs where the theme is [[Television]].
*Eminem permitted the parody but requested [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic|Weird Al]] not make a music video for the song, which Al honored, leaving the label baffled on deciding what song to push, which, in turn, fans blame for the poor album sales.
*A [[Wikipedia:Couch potato|couch potato]] is a person who spends most or much of his time sitting or lying on a couch, watching television in his underwear and often drinking beer.

&lt;pre&gt;
Talking: Look
If you had
One shot
To sit on your lazy butt
And watch all the TV you ever wanted
Until your brain turned to mush
Would you go for it
Or just let it slip?  

Singing:
Yo
Remote is ready
Eyes wide, palms are sweaty
There's Flintstone's on the TV already
Wilma N' Betty
No virgin to channel surfin
And I'm HD ready
So I flip, garbage is all I'm getting
There's Simon Cowell
Who folks wanna disembowel
He opens his mouth, always says something foul
They're dying, Wow!
Wannabe's are crying now
He votes them out
Time to throw in the towel

Show's based on reality
Oh the humanity!
Oh! Ozzy's family!
Sho' loves profanity!
Whoa! The insanity!
Oh! Dogs that crap and pee
Home of depravity?
No! They live happily

Yo! Plus &quot;The Ali G Show&quot;
And &quot;Celebrity Mole&quot;
Oh there's Anna Nicole
She's scaring me
&quot;Look ma, no cavities!&quot;
Oh! It's a station break
Better go out to the kitchen and microwave something

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watchin TV&quot;
They told me, they'd scold me
But I still tune in every show (show)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TV Land and HBO
The Travel Channel, Discovery, and Lifetime (yo)

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watchin' TV&quot;
They told me, cajoled me
&quot;Turn off those music videos!&quot; (no!)
I'm gonna watch C-SPAN TV Land and HBO
The History Channel and QVC and Lifetime (yo)
&quot;You're Gonna...&quot;

My butt is aching
As I watch NASCAR racing
That show about undertaking
Larry King to &quot;24&quot; to &quot;Law and Order&quot;
The Weather Channel's boring like 60 Minutes
Ancient reporters next up on &quot;E True Hollywood Story&quot;
The rise and decline of twelve actors named Corey

Shows for next fall, they've already been naming
&quot;CSI: Boise&quot;, and &quot;Touched By An Uncle&quot;, both sound prettying lame, man
so does &quot;Everybody Tolerates Raymond&quot;
and &quot;King of Queens&quot; jumped the shark the first minute
I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it.

I'll move right on to &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenaged Daughter&quot;
Then I bet I'll watch &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;
Followed by &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;
And &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; where they go &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot;

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watching TV&quot;
They told me, they'd scold me
But I still tune in every show (show)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TV Land and HBO
The Disney Channel, and A&amp;E and Lifetime

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watching TV&quot;
They told me, cajoled me
But I still love Lisa Kudrow (drow)
I'm lookin' at C-SPAN, TV Land and HBO
The Playboy Channel and Court TV and Lifetime (yo)

Never missed &quot;Melrose Place&quot; or &quot;Lost in Space&quot;
I've seen each &quot;Amazing Race&quot; and &quot;Without a Trace&quot;
But I only watched &quot;Will and Grace&quot; one time one day
Wished I hadn't cause TiVo now thinks I'm gay

Oh, and &quot;Fear Factor&quot; I watched maybe a half hour
After that felt like I needed a long shower
Network execs with naked ambition
&quot;Next week on FOX - watch lions eat Christians!&quot;

Like to tie up those programming planners
Make'em watch all of that junk 'til their heads explode just like &quot;Scanners&quot;
Leech-covered grub-eating fools on &quot;Survivor&quot;
Look, there's James Lipton discussing the oeuvre of Mr. Rob Schneider

And there's Gilligan and SpongeBob, plus there's MacGyver
And Jay Leno has got Madonna and hey, there's Luke Perry
And a special all pig-latin episode of &quot;Drew Carey&quot;

Wanna turn on ET cause I'm a gossip freak
And I gotta know who J. Lo is marryin' this week
A 30 second spot, then we come back to &quot;Are You Hot?&quot;
I was planning on recording &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.  I forgot!
I love shows with or without a plot
I stare 'til my legs are numb, my eyes bloodshot
Because I only have got 
one brain to rot
I'm gonna spend my life watching television a lot

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watching TV&quot;
They told me, they'd scold me
But I still tune into every show (show)
My cable's gets C-SPAN, TV-Land, and HBO
The Sci-Fi Channel and AMC and Lifetime (yo!)

&quot;You're gonna lose your mind watching TV&quot;
They told me, cajoled me, 
&quot;Turn off that Oprah Winfrey show!&quot; (no!)
I got it on C-SPAN, TV Land and HBO
The Learning Channel and MTV and Lifetime (yo!)

You can watch anything you want to, man.&lt;/pre&gt;

*&quot;Every '''27'''th customer will get a ball peen hammer free&quot; is another mention of the number [[27]].
*The total count of items in the hardware store is the amazing number of 61 different utensils.  Wow.

* The sound of tools in the beginning may have been inspired by ''Money'' by Pink Floyd
* Al stated that he wouldn't ever perform this song in concert, because of the quick, hard-to-sing lyrics.

Nothin' ever (ever) happens in this town
Feelin' low down (down), not a lot to do around here
I thought that I would go right out of my mind
Until a friend told me the news
He said, &quot;Hey! You know that vacant lot
Right beside the gas station? Well somebody bought it
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop
Where we can go buy bolts and screws&quot;
Since then I've been walking on air (air)
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair
'Cause I'm so excited and I really don't care
I've been waiting since last June
For this day to finally arrive
I'm so happy (happy) now just to be alive
'Cause any minute now I'm gonna be inside
Well, I hope they open soon

I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)
When are they gonna open up that door?
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes I'm goin' to the
Hardware store

In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight
Right in front of the store, then as soon as it was light out
I pressed my nose right up against the glass
You know, I had to be first in line
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house
See those hacksaws? Very, very soon
One of them will be all mine
Guys with nametags walking down the aisles
Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles
All arranged alphabetically
And they're doing a promotional stunt
There's a great big purple sign out front
That says every 27th customer
Will get a ball peen hammer free

I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)
When are they gonna open up that door?
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes I'm goin' to the
Hardware store
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes I'm goin' to the
Hardware store

Would you look at all that stuff.
They've got allen wrenches, gerbil feeders, toilet seats, electric heaters
Trash compactors, juice extractors, shower rods and water meters
Walkie-talkies, copper wires, safety goggles, radial tires
BB pellets, rubber mallets, fans and dehumidifiers
Picture hangers, paper cutters, waffle irons, window shutters
Paint removers, window louvers, masking tape and plastic gutters
Kitchen faucets, folding tables, weather stripping, jumper cables
Hooks and tackle, grout and Spackle, power foggers, spoons and ladles
Pesticides for fumigation, high-performance lubrication
Metal roofing, waterproofing, multi-purpose insulation
Air compressors, brass connectors, wrecking chisels, smoke detectors
Tire gauges, hamster cages, thermostats and bug deflectors
Trailer hitch demagnetizers, automatic circumcisers
Tennis rackets, angle brackets, Duracells and Energizers
Soffit panels, circuit breakers, vacuum cleaners, coffee makers
Calculators, generators, matching salt and pepper shakers

I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)
When are they gonna open up that door?
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes I'm goin' to the
Hardware store
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes I'm goin' to the

Welcome to the Weird Al Wiki if you have questions ask me or the sysops. From, {{User:the thing/sig}}


==Sysops==

Hi, You asked about sysops.  The City bureaucrats are able to make people sysops.  Who they chose is down to the local  practices.  In a young wiki, it's likely that they will just chose the most suitable people from those active and involved.  Later a wiki might have a selection process or votes.  On this wiki, the current bureaucrats are [[User:The thing|The thing]] and [[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 12:18, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

&lt;pre&gt;Finger food and an ice cold keg
It won't cost you an arm and a leg
Dance all night to a rotten band
Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand
Saturday night it's the place to be
Everybody cut footloose with me
At the party at the leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony

Met a little lady so pretty and young
She was quite a talker till the cat got her tongue
She oozed up beside me, I turned on my charm
Well, pretty soon she was completely disarmed
I said, &quot;Girl, now don't fall to pieces on me&quot;
But she cried her eyes out . literally
At the party at the leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony
Hey! Hey!

Hey now, buddy, don't you give me no lip
Sorry I was using your head for a dip
There's a guy in the hot tub, I don't know who
Wait a minute, it looks like Stu
Well, hold the phone now, what do I see?
Another pretty mama got her eye on me
At the party at the leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony
There's a party at the leper colony
(Party at the leper colony)
There's a party at the leper colony
(Party at the leper colony)
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony, yeah, party at the leper colony
Well, there's a party at the leper colony
(Party at the leper colony)
Hey!&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;[LAST RESORT (Papa Roach)]
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a... if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and a-crying

[CHOP SUEY! (System Of A Down)]
Wake up! (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
(Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die, die, die
D-d-die die die die die
Hey!

[GET FREE (The Vines)]
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
Ride into the sun
She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?

(Come here, come here, come here)
I'll take your photo for ya
(Come here, come here, come here)
Drive you around the corner
(Come here, come here, come here)
You know you really oughta
(Come here, come here, come here)
Move out to California*

[HATE TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO (The Hives)]
Do what I want 'cause I can, if I don't because I wanna
Be ignored by the stiff and the bored because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, alright
Do believe I told you so
Now it's all out and you knew
'Cause I wanted to

[FELL IN LOVE WITH A GIRL (The White Stripes)]
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love at once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
Can't think of anything to do
Yeah, my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Yeah, I said it once before but it bears repeating, now

[LAST NITE (The Strokes]
Last night
She said
&quot;Oh baby, don't you feel so down
When you turn me off
When I feel left out&quot;

So I (what'd you do?)
Well, I turned around (right around)
&quot;Oh, baby, gonna be alright&quot;
It was a great big lie (big old lie)
'Cause I left that night
Yeah

[DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS (Disturbed)]
Ooh ah ah ah ah!
Ooh ah ah ah ah!

Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Get up!
Come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

[RENEGADES OF FUNK (Rage Against The Machine)]
We're the renegades of funk, we're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk, we're the renegades of funk

[MY WAY (Limp Bizkit)]
This time I'm a let it all come out
This time I'm a stand up and shout
I'm a do things my way
It's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'm a let it all come out
This time I'm a stand up and shout
I'm a do things my way
It's my way
...or the highway

[OUTSIDE (Staind)]
But I'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
Ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

BAWITDABA (Kid Rock)]
Bawitdaba da bang da dang diggy diggy
Diggy said the boogie said up jump the boogie
Bawitdaba da bang da dang diggy diggy
Diggy said the boogie said up jump the boogie

[YOUTH OF THE NATION (P.O.D.)]
We are, we are
The youth of the nation
We are, we are
The youth of the nation
We are, we are
The youth of the nation
We are the youth of the nation!
Hey!

[THE REAL SLIM SHADY (Eminem)]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please, please
Please stand up

Slim Shady won't you please stand up?
(Stand up Shady)(Stand up)
(Stand up Shady)(Stand up)
(Stand up Shady)
Shady won't you please stand up?
Hey!&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
*The song composed mostly of excessively bad (or just plain bizarre) pick-up lines.

*According to Al, when asked who's [[Style Parody|style]] is being parodied, he answered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Wikipedia:Prince (artist)|Prince]]-like title throws a lot of people, but that song is actually intended to sound like me trying to sound like [[Wikipedia:Beck|Beck]] trying to sound like Prince.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*[[Wikipedia:Ectomorphic|Ectomorphic]] is one of the three classic body types. Examples of ectomorphs would be marathon runners, swimmers, basketball players and fashion models.

&lt;pre&gt;I don't have a library card
But do you mind if I check you out?
I like your skeletal structure, baby
You're an ectomorph, no doubt
Your face is real symmetrical
And your nostrils are so nice
I wish that I was cross-eyed
So I could see you twice

Girl, you smell like Fritos
That's why I'm giving you this hungry stare
You're so hot, you're gonna melt
The elastic in my underwear
I'll bet you're magically delicious
Like a bowl of Lucky Charms
You'd look like Venus de Milo
If I just cut off your arms
What I'm tryin' to say is...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

Do you believe in love at fist sight
Or should I walk by again?
My love for you's like diarrhea
I just can't hold it in
Stop, drop and roll now
'Cause baby, you're on fire
I'll bet your outfit
Makes a lot of noise in the drier

You're absolutely perfect
Don't speak now, you might spoil it
Your eyes are even bluer
Than the water in my toilet
Say, has anyone ever told you
You've got Yugoslavian hands?
No, of course not, that would be stupid
Just forget I ever brought it up
The point I'm trying to make is...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

I wanna be your Krakatoa
Let my lava flow all over you
I wanna be your anaconda
And your heat-seeking missile too
I wanna be your beef burrito
Am I making this perfectly clear?
I wanna be your love torpedo
Are you picking up the subtle innuendo here?
Uh huh

I hope I'm not being forward
But do you mind if I chew on your butt?
You can tell me truthfully
Am I a steamin' hunk of love now, or what?
There just aren't enough o's in &quot;smooth&quot;
To describe how smooth I am
Maybe you've seen my picture
It's in the dictionary under &quot;Kablaam!&quot;
My lips are registered weapons
Can I invade your personal space?
You must have fallen from heaven
That would explain how you messed up your face
Well, how'd you get through security?
'Cause baby, you're the bomb
I'd like to take you home right now
So you can meet my mom
Because I...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

Girl, you must be Jamaican
Because Jamaican me crazy
Girl, you must be Jamaican
Because Jamaican me crazy

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
*In interviews, Al said that he had three incomplete parodies of this song, and was unsure of which one to finish, so he just used all three partial parodies instead, one per verse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">&lt;pre&gt;Uh huh... extra cheese
Uh huh, uh huh... save a piece for me

Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
19 extra larges - what a shame
No one came
Just us, eatin' all alone
You said, &quot;Take the pizza home&quot;
&quot;No sense lettin' all this go to waste&quot;
So then I faced
Pizza all day
And every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care
For irregularity

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom... I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take the laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No no no

I was feelin' pretty down
Till my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say
In fact, I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me
Who would have guessed
Her family crest
I'd suddenly spy
Tattooed on her thigh
And son-of-a-gun
It's just like the one on me

Tell me
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No no no

I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide
Said not to stand
But that's a demand
That I couldn't meet
I got on my feet
And stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see

Tell me
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience , oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag now... Can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated
Oh no

Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated? (Yeah yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer
Can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated
No no no&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Is it on? Okay
1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 6
Let me tell you 'bout the school cafeteria
It's got all the others beat
It sells over four million burgers a year
Just think, that's almost two pounds of meat

My ice cream sandwich is lukewarm
But my burrito is much too cold
A school cafeteria is the only place
That sells artificially colored mold

You know a school cafeteria believes in mass production
They buy those lousy soy beans by the keg
I don't like to complain, but in a school cafeteria
You can get a taco and get Bubonic Plague

Today in the school cafeteria
They introduced a brand new malt
It's called boysenberry dysentery
Please pass the salt

The tuna fish sandwiches'll make you ill
The enchiladas are enough to kill
Before you eat, you'd better make out your will
In the school cafeteria today

Say, boys and girls, tired of being skinny
Eat a school lunch today
All starch and cholesterol
Absolutely no protein
Remember, fourteen million teenagers can't be wrong

Feel your arteries growing hard
As you eat another healthy spoonful of lard

It's no wonder that the food is so gross
The health department is afraid to come close
So everybody better hold your nose
In the school cafeteria today

So listen very closely, all you girls and guys
Here's a little message to the wise
You'd better not try the chili surprise
In the school cafeteria today, oh yeah
In the school cafeteria today
&lt;/pre&gt;

You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby's kinda nauseating

[burps]

My little vulgar one is so gross
'Cause when I hold her in my arms so close she goes

[burps]
And out in public it's embarrassing
She'll burp at anyone or anything
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

My little lady's so obnoxious
Today she walked onto a Greyhound bus goin'

[burps]

And then a couple hours later
My baby's in a crowded elevator

[burps]

That little filthy pig is so obscene
I'm really glad she doesn't like beans
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

Oh, I wonder what's her trip
Oh, she'd better can it quick
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick

If baby does it anymore
I think I'll just pretend like I don't know her

[burps]

You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby is really sickening

[burps]

That's enough, that's it

[record scratch]

&lt;pre&gt;
Ridin' in a bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smellin' like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We're already packed in like sardines
But we're stoppin' to pick up more
Look out

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

There's a suitcase pokin' me in the ribs
There's an elbow in my ear
There's a smelly old bum standin' next to me
Hasn't showered in a year
Well, I think I'm missin' a contact lens
I think my wallet's gone
And I think this bus is stoppin' again
To let a couple more freaks get on
Look out

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

Yeah

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus, ow
Another one rides the bus, hey, hey
Another one rides the bus, hey

The window doesn't open, and the fan is broke
And my face is turnin' blue
I haven't been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see The Who
Well, I should've got off a couple miles ago
But I couldn't get to the door
There isn't any room for me to breathe
Now we're gonna pick up more, yeah

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

No
No
Huh?
Yeah
Yeah

&lt;pre&gt;
I met him in a swamp down in Dagoba
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
S-O-D-A, soda

I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said &quot;Yoda&quot;
Y-O-D-A, Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I left home just a week before
And I've never ever been a Jedi before
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
He said, &quot;Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force&quot;

Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
With my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

So I used the Force
I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said

He said, &quot;Luke, stay away from the darker side
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide&quot;
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

&quot;I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed&quot;
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back some day
I'll be playing this part 'till I'm old and gray

The long-term contract that I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time
With my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

&lt;pre&gt;
I visit Mr. Frump in the hospital
I see him most every day
And when I see Mr. Frump in his iron lung
This is what I hear him say

(electronic breathing)

Y'know, Mr. Frump is my very best friend
He's never a chump or a tease
He never tells me lies, and best of all
He never disagrees

I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon
Sit down by his side and say &quot;Hi&quot;
And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation
And I wait for Mr. Frump's reply, and Mr. Frump would say

(electronic breathing)

Well, unfortunately, soon it came to be
Mr. Frump's dying day
And now I bring to you the very last thing
That Mr. Frump had to say....

(electronic breathing, that fades and dies off)

Amen
&lt;/pre&gt;

Gotta boogie
Gotta boogie
Gotta boogie
Gotta boogie
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

Well, I went out to a party just the other night
I was jammin' to the music, I was feelin' alright
I was burning up the floor like a disco maniac
When my woman said, &quot;Baby, why's your hand behind you back?&quot;

Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)
I said boogie (gotta boogie)
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

I can't pick it off (uh uh)
I can't flick it off (uh uh)
I sure ain't gonna lick it off (oh no)
So I guess I'm gonna have to learn to live with it

I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

(boogie)
Gotta boogie
(boogie)

Hey, you wanna boogie? (No man, I don't wanna boogie)
Wanna boogie? (Get that boogie out of my face)
Do any of you wanna boogie? (No!)

Gotta boogie on my finger
Gotta boogie on my finger
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I don't care about your karma
I don't care about what's hip
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do

I won't swim in your Jacuzzi
You can't make me settle down
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch
And scream until I'm blue

I may as well be hyper
As long as I'm still around
'Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back
When I'm six feet under ground

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

When are you
Cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your head

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I can't stand the smell of incense
I don't really like to jog
No Joni Mitchell eight-tracks in my car (ooh)

I hate anything organic
Even health food makes me sick
You won't catch me sipping Perrier
Down in some sushi bar

I tell you, now's the time to go for
All the gusto you can grab
You'll have plenty of time to be low key
When you're laid out on the slab

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

When are you
Cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your head

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

Ow!

I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans
No redwood hot tub to my name

I got all that I want
And if it's all the same to you
I don't need a course in self-awareness
To find out who I am

And I'd rather have a
a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan

So don't ask me what I'm into
I don't need to prove I'm cool
I'll break your arm
If you ask me what's my sign

I won't tell you where my head's at
I don't need to see no shrink
Psychosis may be in this year
But I'm really not that kind

And I'm in no hurry to be casual
In fact I think I'll wait
Until I'm pushing up the daisies
(Like, wow, man, can you relate)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)
I'll be mellow when I'm dead (I'll be mellow when I'm dead)

==Trivia==
*This is Al's first single.
*It was originally recorded in a tiled men's bathroom across from KCPR which is a college raio station only using Weird Al's vocals and Al's accordion.
*The song is talking about Bologna sausage, although referencing to Oscar Meyer's Bologna.
*The original recording is on the compilation album Dr. Demento's Dementia Royale
*The original recording made number 3 on Dr Demento's Funny Twenty-five.
*It was re-recorded for Weird Al's [[Album:&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic|first studio album]]
*There is no official music video, although an early demo was shot showing Al lip-syncing to the song at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the December of 1979. It can be found as an easter egg on the DVD [[The Ultimate Video Collection]]
*The capitol records version is on [[Album:Permanent Record: Al In The Box|Permanent Record.]]</text>

==Trivia==
*In this song, Al tells the story of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace perfectly despite the fact that the song was released just weeks prior to The Phantom Menace's release.
* The music video for this song was shot in a blistering hot Mojave Desert (the opening and ending scenes) and an air-conditioned soundstage (the cantina scene).
* “Weird Al” plays Obi-Wan as a padawan in the music video.
* The Emperor can be seen playing the piano, and Mace Windu can be seen dancing.

I do not make it a regular habit of doing that. Second, although I can certainly notice the jumps in logic you come up with, I am not confident of exactly how you seem to unite the details that help to make your final result. For right now I will, no doubt subscribe to your point but hope in the near future you link your dots better.</text>

To be honest, this template looks a little bit plain. I'm going to do a rewrite of it at [[/revision1]] if that's okay with everyone.--[[User:Mewrio|Mewrio]] 20:42, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::It should be optional. In fact, I might just get rid of that. I'm just trying to fix the lack of borders. (It's loosely based on the TV series template at Wikipedia).--[[User:Mewrio|Mewrio]] 07:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)
:::It's good, but this template takes up abuot most of the pages info. Until we gather more info, leave the template dormant for now. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 23:37, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

&lt;pre&gt;
A long, long time ago
In a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the federation into
Maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response, it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the Queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy...

Oh my my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' &quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;
&quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;

Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave
And he can use the Force, they say
Ahh, do you see him hitting on the queen
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
Yah, he's probably gonna marry her someday
Well, I knew he built C-3PO
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke, it's true
So we made a wager or two
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
Well, I knew who would win first place
Oh yes, it was our boy

We started singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' &quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;
&quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;

Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be
So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance to the Force?
They interview the kid
Oh, training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said &quot;Now listen here&quot;
&quot;Just stick it in your pointy ear&quot;
&quot;I still will teach this boy&quot;

He was singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' &quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;
&quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;

We caught a ride back to Naboo
'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay
We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
And in the end some Gunguns died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croakin'
The battle droids were broken
And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy

And I was singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' &quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;
&quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;

We were singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' &quot;Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;I was watching my TV one night when they broke in with a special report
About some devastating earthquake in Peru
There were thirty thousand crushed to death, even more were buried alive
On the Richter scale it measured 8.2
And I said, &quot;God, please answer me one question...
Why'd they have to interrupt The Simpsons just for this?&quot;
What a drag, 'cause I was taping it and everything
And now I'll have to wait for the rerun to see the part of the show I missed

Why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?

I was driving down the highway when all the traffic slowed to a crawl
There was a 12-car pile-up, everybody dead
And I saw brains and guts and vital organs splattered everywhere
As well as my friend Robert's disembodied head
And I thought - Poor Rob, I just had lunch with him
Hey, wait a minute, he still owes me money . what a jerk
Well, there's five bucks that I'm never gonna see again
Plus now, on top of everything else, it looks like I'm gonna be late to work

Oh, why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?

Oh, the other day my boss said we were running low on toner
And he told me I should buy another case
Well, I told him I was busy, but he still just kept on asking
So I turned around and stabbed him in the face
Oh, and wouldn't you know it?
My knife got stuck
I guess that's probably bound to happen now and then
But I'm afraid I may have bent the tip a little
And I know the blade will never ever be quite as sharp again

Oh tell me, why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen...
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen to me?&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Poor Peter Parker was pitiful
Couldn't have been any shyer
Mary Jane still wouldn't notice him
Even if his hair was on fire
But then one day he went to that science lab
That mutated spider came down
Oh, and now Peter crawls over everyone's walls
And he's swingin' all over town
La li la, li de da
La la, li le la da dom

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause we're all in the mood for a hero now
And there's evil-doers to fight

Now Harry the rich kid's a friend of his
Who horns in on Mary Jane
But to his great surprise it seems she prefers guys
Who can kiss upside-down in the rain
&quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;
That's the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben
If you missed it, don't worry, they'll say the line
Again and again and again
Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dom

Now Norman's a billionaire scientist
Who never had time for his son
But then something went screwy and before you knew he
Was trying to kill everyone
And he's ridin' around on that glider thing
And he's throwin' that weird pumpkin bomb
Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask
But he's scarier without it on

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause you're brave and you're strong and so limber now
But where'd you come up with those tights?

It's a pretty sad day at the funeral
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust
And I heard Harry's said he wants Spider-Man dead
Aw, but his buddy Pete he can trust
Oh, and M.J. is all hot for Peter now
Aw, but Peter, he just shuts her down
Mary Jane, don't you cry, you can give it a try
Again when the sequel comes 'round
Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dom

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause we all sure could use us a hero now
And we think that you'll do all right&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
'Cause I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a mam
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo figaro - Magnifico... Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Will not let you go - let him go
Will not let you go - let him go
No, no, no, no, no no no no no!

Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me (Nothing matters! Nothing matters! Nothing matters!)
Anyway the wind-- Anyway the wind-- Anyway the wind blows
Hey!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14493">==Why wasn't there a music video for Poodle Hat?==

Al was actually planning to do a video for “Couch Potato” (his parody of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”). But unfortunately, even though Eminem was okay with Al having the parody on his album, for some strange reason he denied permission for Al to make a music video for the song. Since Al was already in pre-production on the video and also had to put together his AL-TV special and gear up for a 3-month concert tour, he didn’t have the time to switch gears and do a video for a different song. Al did put together a couple of makeshift videos for AL-TV (including one for the song “Bob” which was a dead-on parody of Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” from the Don’t Look Back documentary), but those were low-budget quickies that were intended to be exclusive to the VH1 special.

==I've found some songs on the Internet that are supposedly by Al, but I've never heard them on any of his albums. What the hey?==

Unfortunately, there are a lot of song parodies floating around the Internet being attributed to Al which are in fact done by somebody else. &quot;Star Wars Cantina,&quot; &quot;Windows 95 Sucks,&quot; &quot;Living La Vida Yoda,&quot; &quot;Combo No. 5,&quot; &quot;What If God Smoked Cannabis,&quot; &quot;He Got The Wrong Foot Amputated&quot; (the list goes on and on... some of the titles are unprintable in a family-friendly web site) - these songs are NOT by Al. If you want to verify whether or not a song is actually by Al, check the [http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm Catalogue page].

==How did Al get his start in the music business?==

As a teenager, Al began sending homemade tapes of his songs to Dr. Demento, a nationally syndicated disc jockey known for playing comedy and novelty music. Demento found a certain charm in the accordion-powered ditties that Al recorded on a cheap cassette player in his own bedroom, and gave him his first airplay. By the time Al graduated from college, he not only had a modest cult following from the good Doctor's radio show, but he also had a couple of nationally-released singles (&quot;My Bologna&quot; and &quot;Another One Rides The Bus&quot;). In 1982 he signed a deal with Scotti Bros. Records, who went on to release all of his albums through Bad Hair Day (1996). Volcano Records eventually bought Scotti Bros. Records, issuing Running With Scissors and Poodle Hat, and re-releasing Al's entire catalog on the Volcano/Way Moby label.

==Does Al get permission to do his parodies?==

Al does get permission from the original writers of the songs that he parodies. While the law supports his ability to parody without permission, he feels it's important to maintain the relationships that he's built with artists and writers over the years. Plus, Al wants to make sure that he gets his songwriter credit (as writer of new lyrics) as well as his rightful share of the royalties.



==What do the original artists think of the parodies?==

Most artists are genuinely flattered and consider it an honor to have Weird Al parody their work. Some groups (including Nirvana) claim that they didn't realize that they had really &quot;made it&quot; until Weird Al did a parody of them!

==What about Coolio? I heard that he was upset with Al about &quot;Amish Paradise.&quot;==

That was a very unfortunate case of misunderstanding between Al's people and Coolio's people. Short version of the story: Al recorded &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; after being told by his record label that Coolio had given his permission for the parody. When Al's album came out, Coolio publicly contended that he had never given his blessing, and that he was in fact very offended by the song. To this day we’re not exactly sure who got their facts wrong, but Al sincerely apologizes to Coolio for the misunderstanding.

==Have any artists ever turned Al down for a parody?==

Even though most recording artists really do have a pretty good sense of humor, on a few very rare occasions Al has been denied permission to do a parody. Actually, the only artist to turn Al down consistently over the years has been the Artist Formerly Known As The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. Go figure.

==Does Al only do parodies of other songs?==

Uh, no. About half of the songs on Al's albums are originals, meaning that Al wrote the music as well as the lyrics. Some originals are in the style of another artist (like “Bob” or “Genius In France”), but they’re still entirely new compositions. If you're not sure whether a song is an original or a parody, check the writing credits in the liner notes of Al’s albums.

==Who are Al's musical influences?==

Al credits Spike Jones, Stan Freberg, Tom Lehrer, Allan Sherman, Shel Silverstein, Frank Zappa and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the Dr. Demento Radio Show.

==What's Al's full name?==

Alfred Matthew Yankovic.

==Where was Al born?==

Al is the only child of Nick &amp; Mary Yankovic. He grew up in Lynwood, California (a suburb of Los Angeles), although the hospital he was actually born in was in the neighboring town of Downey.

==How old is he now?==

Al was born at 1:56 PM on October 23, 1959. You figure it out.

==Where did Al go to school?==

Al attended Lynwood High school, where he was a straight-A student and graduated as Valedictorian at the age of 16. From there he went to the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, where he got a degree in Architecture.

==Did Al ever have any &quot;real&quot; jobs before he got famous?==

In high school Al was a part-time accordion teacher and occasional accordion repo-man (don't ask). After graduating from college, Al decided that architecture was not for him, so he worked for a few years in the mailroom and later at a desk job for a large radio syndication company in Culver City, California.

==What are Al's physical statistics?==

Al is 6'-0&quot; tall and weighs between 170 and 175 pounds (when he’s in shape). He has brown eyes and naturally curly (no perm!) reddish brown hair. His shoe size is 10½, his underwear size is Medium, his shirt size is usually Large, and his head is larger-than-human.

==What happened to Al’s moustache and glasses?==

In January 1998 Al got LASIK (Laser Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis) surgery to correct his near-sightedness, so he no longer needs to wear glasses. He decided to get rid of the facial hair about the same time, although he sometimes grows it back when nobody’s looking.

==What is Al’s marital status?==

Al got married on February 10, 2001 to his wife Suzanne. They have a daughter named Nina, born February 11, 2003.

==Where does Al live now?==

Al, Suzanne and Nina live with their cockatiel Bo and poodle Bela (yes, that’s her on the album cover) in their home in the Hollywood hills.

==Is Al related to the famous accordion-playing Polka King, Frankie Yankovic?==

No, although they were friends for many years. (In October 1998, Frankie passed away at his home in Florida at the age of 83.)

==What nationality is Al?==

Al's grandparents on his father's side were Yugoslavian, and on his mother's side they were Italian and English.

==How did Al get the name &quot;Weird Al&quot;?==

Although he seems to remember people calling him &quot;Weird Al&quot; during his freshman year in the Cal Poly dorms, it didn't become official until Al started doing shifts as a DJ at his campus radio station, KCPR. He gave himself the air-name of &quot;Weird Al&quot; because of his penchant for playing music that was, well, kind of weird… and the nickname just kind of stuck.

==What instruments does Al play?==

Although he can play other keyboard instruments, the accordion has always been Al's main &quot;axe,&quot; and he continues to play it on record as well as in concert. His first lesson was on the day before his 7th birthday. After three years of accordion lessons, he quit, deciding to continue learning on his own.

==Is Al a vegetarian?==

Yes. He changed his diet in 1992 after a fan gave him a book called &quot;Diet For A New America.&quot; He currently eats no meat and also tries to avoid eggs and dairy products.

==Can I send my song ideas to Al?==

Sorry, for legal and personal reasons, Al does not accept song ideas from fans (he's got plenty warped ideas on his own!) You might try following in Al's footsteps by recording your songs and sending them to Dr. Demento - maybe you'll hear yourself on the radio!

==How can I get an autograph from Al?==

While it's certainly never guaranteed, sometimes after one of his concerts Al will meet with fans and sign autographs before he's ready to leave the venue (around an hour or so after the show has ended). He also occasionally holds in-store signing appearances. You can also try sending a letter (and a stamp) to Close Personal Friends Of Al and asking reeeeal nice, but be prepared to wait a good, long while.

==Where can I get Al's records, videos and merchandise?==

Al's records and videos can be purchased (or ordered) from your favorite local retail outlet or on-line store, or directly from the weirdal.com Merchandise page. Check our Audio/Video Catalogue for more info.

==Where can I get sheet music for Al's songs?==

Try The &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic Anthology, a songbook featuring complete lyrics and sheet music for piano, vocal and guitar on 13 Weird Al favorites (&quot;Harvey The Wonder Hamster,&quot; &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; &quot;You Don't Love Me Anymore,&quot; &quot;Frank's 2000&quot; TV,&quot; &quot;Since You've Been Gone,&quot; &quot;One More Minute,&quot; &quot;Good Old Days,&quot; &quot;Headline News,&quot; &quot;The Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota,&quot; &quot;Christmas At Ground Zero,&quot; &quot;Smells Like Nirvana,&quot; &quot;Eat It&quot; and &quot;Yoda&quot;). You can order it from your favorite music store (Cherry Lane, Order #ISBN 1-57560-021-8)

==What is &quot;The Authorized Al&quot;?==

&quot;The Authorized Al&quot; (written by Tino Insana with some help from Al) is a book that was published by Contemporary Books in 1985. It was released as a companion piece to the home video mockumentary &quot;The Compleat Al.&quot; Unfortunately, the book has been out of print for quite some time and is extremely rare.

==What happened to The Weird Al Show?==

The Weird Al Show was a Saturday morning (in most markets) half-hour TV show on CBS starring Al and a recurring cast of characters, including the Hooded Avenger (Brian Haley), Madame Judy (Judy Tenuta), J.B. Toppersmith (Stan Freberg) and of course, Harvey the Wonder Hamster. Although it was an educational TV show (by FCC requirement), the show managed to sneak in a little of Al's subversive humor – as well as a few very cool guest stars and musical acts. Unfortunately, in January 1998 the management at CBS decided to cancel their entire Saturday morning lineup. The Weird Al Show ran from September 13, 1997 to September 26, 1998.

==What is AL-TV?==

Every now and then (oddly enough, usually around the time that there's an album to promote) Al will dust off his pirate satellite broadcasting transmitter and take over the airwaves of MTV or VH1. Al has done 9 AL-TV specials since 1984, with the shows ranging between 1 hour and 4 hours in length. During the course of a typical special, Al &quot;interviews&quot; some of his close personal friends in the music biz, shows off the talents of his best-friend-in-the-whole-world Harvey the Wonder Hamster, and of course plays all the videos that HE wants to watch!

==Has Al's cult-hit movie UHF been released on DVD yet?==

As a matter of fact, MGM Home Video released the DVD of [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKHX/theweirdalyan-20/002-4453938-4271233 UHF] on June 4, 2002 and it immediately became a Top 10 best-seller! Al was very involved in the production of the special features, which include a deleted scenes package, a behind the scenes documentary, and a running commentary with Al and director Jay Levey (along with special guest appearances by co-stars Michael Richards, Victoria Jackson and Emo Philips).

==What is Alcon?==

[http://www.finepointproductions.com/alcon3/ Alcon] is a &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic convention that is put on for fans, by fans. The last one took place April 26-27, 2002 at the World Famous Elk Grove Village Holiday Inn. It featured Al talking about what fans could expect on the upcoming DVD for UHF and Bermuda showing some rare and exclusive video from his personal collection. Both signed autographs and took pictures with the several hundred fans who came from around the world to attend. There have officially been 3 Alcons so far, and there may or may not be more in the future.

==Did Al release any songs that were not included on any of his studio albums?==

Al recorded &quot;Polkamon&quot; which appears on the Pokémon 2000 soundtrack. The &quot;Theme From Spy Hard&quot; is available only as the B-side of the &quot;Gump&quot; single. And the Crash Test Dummies parody &quot;Headline News&quot; did not appear on a studio album, although it did come out on the Permanent Record box set, Greatest Hits – Vol. II and its very own CD single. A few of Al's CD singles have featured alternate mixes and karaoke versions of some of his songs as bonus tracks, so you may want to track those down as well.

==Where can I track down Al’s really old stuff?==

Every year around Christmastime the [http://www.drdemento.com/ Demento Society] mails out a special CD - Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes - to its members, that usually includes an ancient &quot;unreleased&quot; track from Al, like &quot;Pacman&quot; or &quot;It's Still Billy Joel To Me.&quot; &quot;School Cafeteria&quot; was released as the B-side of the &quot;My Bologna&quot; single (Capitol Records, 1979) and a live version appears on Basement Tapes #7. A song about Al's college town (San Luis Obispo, California) called &quot;Take Me Down&quot; was originally issued on a very rare 1978 album called SLO Grown, and also appears on Basement Tapes #8 and a CD compilation called SLO Unplugged II, and the demos for &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; and &quot;Stop Draggin' My Car Around&quot; appear on Basement Tapes #9 and #10 respectively. &quot;Baby Likes Burping&quot; appears on #11, which was released by the Doctor in May, 2003. Early recordings of &quot;Gotta Boogie,&quot; “Happy Birthday” and &quot;Mr.Frump In The Iron Lung&quot; can be found on the extremely rare 1981 Placebo EP release of “Another One Rides The Bus.”

You may also want to read the text of the booklet from [http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/al.booklet &quot;Permanent Record – Al In The Box&quot;] to learn more about Al than anybody really needs to know.

If you still have an unanswered question, try looking through the [http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm Ask Al archives], or asking [[Talk:FAQ|here]].

Or… feel free to [http://www.weirdal.com/aa.htm &quot;Ask Al&quot;] yourself!</text>

''Greg Osborne of Vista, CA asks: Hey, Al! So what was it like doing “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition”?''

'''I had a great time. Nothing like flying to Wells, Maine for a day! I never got to actually meet the family, but Ty, the designers and all the workers couldn’t have been nicer. (For those who didn’t see the episode, the gag was that the girl in the family apparently really loved polka dots, so Ty got “confused” and thought she loved polka – ergo my appearance in the show.) I hear some fans were upset that the girl didn’t seem too happy about me playing that polka for her, but that was the joke – if she had looked like she was enjoying it, it wouldn’t have been as funny. They shot a lot of footage – after I serenaded Amanda (actually I serenaded Ty’s video camera – the family didn’t see the footage until a week or so later) I went around the construction site with my accordion and annoyed the workers with polka music for about an hour. Of course, prime-time network TV reality shows being what they are, they only used a very small portion of what they shot. In fact, the song that I wrote for the show was cut down considerably. Here are the full lyrics:'''

''&lt;b&gt;Well, there’s a girl named Amanda who lives in Wells, Maine
She never has boys or shopping on her brain
There’s only one thing drivin’ her insane
All she cares about is polka
Congratulations, Amanda
Rebecca, Doug and Tabitha too
‘Cause I brought my accordion
And soon I will be moving in with you
Because you don’t want 50 Cent here
Or that Matchbox Twenty guy
Oh no, you just want to polka
And so I’ll stay right here and polka polka polka polka polka till I die… hey!
How do you like your new polka room, Amandaaaaa?!&lt;/b&gt;''

''Matt Ceccato of Norcross, GA asks: Did you write your own copy for the material you presented in &quot;I Love The 80s&quot; or was it scripted by someone else?''

'''When I have my own segment (like “Movies That Should Have Been In 3-D”) I am given a script, but I am allowed to re-write it as much as I want. Some bits I wind up using as is, some bits I tweak a little, and some bits I re-write completely. For the question and answer stuff, sometimes I get the questions in advance, sometimes not – but the answers always come from me.'''

''Rachel C. of Lufkin, TX asks: I'm dying to know. Is that really you on myspace.com? If not, someone's out there impersonating you!''

'''I am not on myspace.com. Every now and then I hear about someone on the Internet claiming to be me – and yet, sadly, they are not. Here’s a good way to tell for sure – whenever I have any kind of presence on the Internet, it will be on weirdal.com, or be linked from weirdal.com. Otherwise, it’s highly unlikely that it’s really me.'''

''Nathan Brody of Hamilton Square, New Jersey asks: When you sing songs, do you do the background vocals or the lead vocals first?''

'''I almost always record the lead vocals first. The only exception that comes to mind is “It’s All About The Pentiums.” I had pitched Puff Daddy on the parody idea, and by the time I finally got his official approval, we were already in the final studio sessions for “Running With Scissors”! It was such a last minute addition to the album that I had no choice but to record all the instrument tracks and background vocals first, just to buy me some time to come up with the lyrics. We were mixing the last few songs on the album by the time I finished writing the lyrics to “Pentiums,” and I wound up recording the lead vocals just a couple days before the album had to be mastered. It’s a good thing I work well under pressure!'''

''Garrett Fritzler of Denver, Colorado asks: First I want to say that I think the music you do is great, and even though I like the songs you make fun of, I love your versions even more. But my question is, do you write all the stuff on this website? I know you write the feedbacks to the questions, but what about everything else?''

'''I write the Ask Als, the FAQ, the News and the updates on the splash page… Bermuda writes most of the “funny” captions in the Gallery, compiles the obsessive lists and selects the Fan Art. Pretty much everything else on the site is either written by him or me.'''

* This is one of the many [[&quot;Weird Al&quot;]] songs where the theme is [[Television]].
* “Weird Al” and his band parody in the music video in order: [[Wikipedia:Guns n' Roses|Guns n’ Roses]], [[Wikipedia:George Michael|George Michael]], [[Wikipedia:Robert Palmer|Robert Palmer]], [[Wikipedia:Prince|Prince]], [[Wikipedia:Talking Heads|Talking Heads]], [[Wikipedia:Peter Gabriel|Peter Gabriel]], [[Wikipedia:ZZ Top|ZZ Top]], [[Wikipedia:Billy Idol|Billy Idol]], [[Wikipedia:The Beatles|The Beatles]], [[Wikipedia:INXS|INXS]] and [[Wikipedia:Randy Newman|Randy Newman]].

* The music video for this song is noted as [[“Weird Al”]]’s most ambitious music video to date.
* The only difference between this and the single version is that this has an extended guitar solo and an extended opening.
* Al saying they &quot;control the horizontal&quot; and &quot;the vertical, too&quot; is a reference to the 1963 (jobs) television show [[Wikipedia:The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]].

&lt;pre&gt;
Put down your remote control
Throw out your TV Guide
Put away your jacket
There's no need to go outside
Don't you know that we control the horizontal
We control the vertical, too
We gonna make a couch potato out of you
That's what we gonna do now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF

Disconnect the phone and leave the dishes in the sink
You better put away your homework
Prime time ain't no time to think
All you do is make yourself a TV dinner
Press your face right up against the screen
We gonna show you thangs you ain't ever seen
If you know what I mean, now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF

You can watch us all day
You can watch us all night
You can watch us any time that you please
You can sit around and stare at the picture tube
'Till your brain turns into cottage cheese
Well, now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF (UHF)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">'''To search the Weird al Wiki''':
*There should be a small search box at the side of the screen, marked ''search'', followed by '''Go''' and '''Search'''. Just type what you're looking for into the ''search box'' and press the ''Enter'' key. Or, click '''''Go''''' / '''''Search'''''.  

The most important search tip is: ''don't search for '''only''' words in quotes''. Try the search without quotes first. If that's not good enough, put as many words as possible outside the quotes or add some more to narrow the search.

==Search facility of Weird al Wiki==

The native search feature via the search box that appears on every page is not available during peak hours or other periods of high server activity (which may last for days). Here are some hints for using it effectively:

===Limiting results===

Weird al wiki's default search mode will turn up results with '''''any''''' of the words in your query.  To limit to results that include '''''all''''' words, put a &quot;+&quot; at the beginning of each word to return only pages containing both words, like Google's default mode.

You can also do a '''phrase''' search by enclosing words in quotes.  This turns up a smaller set of results, which not only have both words but have them in order.

To '''exclude''' results that include some word, put a &quot;-&quot; at the beginning.

===Avoid short and common words===

If your search terms include a common &quot;stop word&quot; (such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;which&quot;,
&quot;such&quot;, &quot;every&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;onto&quot;), it will be ignored by the search system. If you're trying to do a phrase search or all-words-only search, this may result in returning nothing at all. Short numbers, and words that appear in half of all articles, will also not be found. In this case, drop those words and rerun the search.

===Wildcards===
You can use some limited wildcards if you need to.  However, wildcard searches are slower, so go easy on the poor server.

===Words in single quotes===
If a word appears in an article with single quotes, you can only find it if you search for the word with quotes. Since this is rarely desirable it is better to use double quotes in articles, for which this problem does not arise.

An apostrophe is identical to a single quote. A word with apostrophe s is an exception in that it can be found also searching for the word without the apostrophe and the s.

===Namespaces searched by default===
The search only applies to the namespaces selected in the preferences. To search the other namespaces check or uncheck the tickboxes in &quot;Search in namespaces&quot; box found at the bottom of a search results page. Depending on the browser, a box may still be checked from a previous search, but without being effective any longer! To make sure, uncheck and recheck it.

Searching the image namespace means searching the image descriptions, i.e. the first parts of the image description pages.

===Redirects can be excluded===
Check or uncheck the tickbox &quot;List redirects&quot; in &quot;Search in namespaces&quot; box found at the bottom of a search results page.

===The source text is searched===   
The source text (what one sees in the edit box, also called wiki text) is searched. This distinction is relevant for piped links, special characters, etc.

== Google ==
By following the links below, you can use the Google search engine to search the Weird Al Wiki. Google indexes all namespaces.

&lt;pre&gt;
Ah, ah, ah, cha cha
Cha, cha, cha, cha cha

Listenin' to the muzac
Hearin' people scream
Sittin' in the waiting room
Readin' crappy magazines
With a toothache
This is it, pal
Root canal

My molars are impacted
I'm gettin' gum disease
I'm gonna need some fillings
Got twelve cavities
Can you help me
Have mercy
Doctor please

My teeth are afright
Got a huge overbite
Numb me, drill me, floss me, bill me

You're jab at my nerve endings
It's drivin' me insane
Just give me nitrous oxide
Shoot me up with Novocaine
Help me out here
'Cause I'm in severe
Pain

Please stop for a bit
Now let me rinse and spit
Numb me, drill me, floss me, bill me

Hey!
Oh, oh!
Ah, ah, ah, cha cha

Validate my parking
I think that I'm okay
Should make one more appointment
For a week from Saturday
'Cause you came upon
A little problem on
My X-Ray, oy vey!

It's getting absurd
Well, I hope I'm insured, now
Numb me, drill me, floss me, bill me

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Hit my snooze alarm
For the [[27|twenty seventh]] time
Just don't feel like goin' to work
I think I'll call my boss the I
Am gonna hack and cough and wheeze
Swear I got some strange disease
What's that little twerp gonna say

I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today

I could shine my pennies and clean my lava lamp
I could spend all day in my underwear watchin' Earnest Goes to Camp
I could sit and count my hair
I could burn my Tupperware
I'm not busy now anyway

I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today
Ain't goin' to work, no way
Callin' in sick today

I can do
Anything I want to
I am invincible
I'm on fire, baby
I'm alive, I'm alive
Can you hear me world, I'm alive!

Maybe I'll spend all day starin' at the sun and tryin' not to squint
Maybe I'll make a huge colored tapestry from my belly button lint
When I'm sick of takin' abuse
I just make up some lame excuse
Freedom's just seven digits away

I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today
Ain't goin' to work, no way
Callin' in sick today

&lt;pre&gt;
Gump sat alone on a bench in the park
&quot;My name is Forrest,&quot; he casually remarked
Waitin' for the bus with his hands in his pockets
He just kept sayin', &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates.&quot;

He's Gump
He's Gump
What's in his head
He's Gump
He's Gump
He's Gump
Is he inbred

Gump was a big celebrity
He told JFK that he really had to pee
He never feels to dumb because
His mom always told him, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;


He's Gump
He's Gump
He's kinda square
He's Gump
He's Gump
He's Gump
What's with that hair
Wa-hoo!

Run run
Run run now Forrest
Run run
Run like the wind now
Run run
Run run now Forrest
Run stop

His buddy Bubba was a shrimp lovin' man
His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut
Went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt

He's Gump
He's Gump
He's not too bright
He's Gump
He's Gump
He's Gump
But he's alright

Is this Gump out of his head
I think so
Is this Gump really brain dead
I think so
Yeah! Woo!
Is this Gump make lotsa bread
I think so
And that's all I have to say
About that!

&lt;/pre&gt;

Forum: [http://www.weirdalforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=4606 Forum Discussion Page]

==Music Video==
The music video parodies the &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot; music video, with these differences from the original:

* It takes place in an ice cream parlor, rather than in a bar.
* It was shot in color rather than in black and white (although the Joan Jett original was shot in color initially). 
* It was videotaped rather than filmed.
* In &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot;, Joan Jett says &quot;Ow!&quot; twice for her enthusiasm. In &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;, Weird Al says &quot;Ow!&quot; because he eats ice cream so fast that he gets a brain freeze. The second time he says &quot;Ow!&quot; because a kid comes up to him and bites his leg.
* [[Dr. Demento]] makes a cameo appearance as the cashier.
*The ice cream in the video was actually mashed potatoes because real ice cream would melt under the stage lights.

==Trivia==
* Rocky Road has been revealed to be [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]'s favorite ice cream flavor.
* Dr. Demento makes a cameo in the music video as the cashier.
* This song was on &quot;Weird Al&quot;'s first album.
* The music video for this song was filmed a restaurant (not an ice-cream parlour) in Agua Dulce, California
* The ice cream in the video was actually mashed potatos because real ice cream would have melted under the stage lights.
* This song is part of the [[Food Medley]].

&lt;pre&gt;
There's a sale on our gabardine suits today
They're all thirty percent off from yesterday
There's Fortrel polyester, leather, wool, and tweed
Just a Visa or MasterCard is all you need
We've got every color, we've got every shade
We're located next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
We got every fabric that was ever made
But I'm known in this city as the King of Suede

We got portly and regular and extra long
Is my size up there
We got tailors to fix it if it comes out wrong
Is my size up there

We got all kinds of sweatshirts, you can take your pick
Is my size up there
With the collars ripped off like that Flashdance flick
Is my size up there

Our prices are low, my staff is underpaid
You can buy off the rack or have it custom made
And it's all guaranteed to never shrink or fade
'Cause of my reputation as the King of Suede

If you need a tuxedo for your junior prom
Is my size up there
We can get you the best one that's made in Taiwan
Is my size up there

We got jackets with patches on the elbows too
Is my size up there
And we'll sell 'em all factory direct to you
Is my size up there

Well, I never made it past the second grade
It took all of my life for me to learn this trade
But my friends are all thinking that I've got it made
'Cause I'm known the world over as the King of Suede

There's a two for one sale on our three piece suits
Check out our suede pajamas and our suede covered boots
You can try on our suede underwear if you choose
Do what you want but don't step on my blue suede shoes

King of Suede

Don't miss out on our giant liquidation sale
Is my size up there
Look for our color catalog in next week's mail
Is my size up there

There's a sale on our double knit slacks today
It's the same old sale as yesterday

Thirty years in the same location I have stayed
There I am, right next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
I got tough competition but I'm not afraid
'Cause it's my destiny to be the King of Suede

King of Suede
King of Suede
King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
&lt;/pre&gt;

! Visuals !! Lyrics
|-
| Cut to a stage with a band playing and [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] in the middle. There is a sign reading &quot;WELCOME TO [[Wikipedia:COMDEX|COMDEX]]&quot;. On &quot;Pentiums&quot;, the screen shows the left side of the band, and the right on &quot;baby&quot;. During the line, Al takes off his jacket and throws it into the crowd. After the line, cut to the crowd, all in business clothes. They are raising a fist, then lowering it, and doing it with the other side. Then, cut to a far-off view of the stage, where we notice a disco ball in the center. Al starts raising and lowering his hands in unison. Cut to Al, then a guitar player. || It's All About The Pentiums, baby
|-
| Then, cut to a man wearing a suit and raising a fist at the end of the first &quot;Uh.&quot; Cut to the earlier seen guitar player, then to another man in a suit giving two thumbs-up signs at the end of the first &quot;yeah.&quot; Cut to a full shot of the band, and on the third &quot;uh&quot;, cut to the drummer. Cut to another man in a suit raising a fist. Cut back to Al. A little later we hear the last sentance. || Uh. Uh-huh, yeah. Uh. Uh-huh, yeah.
|-
| Cut to a street outside of a glass office building. A pink and white 50's style car pulls up. ||It's all about the Pentiums, baby
|-
| Cut to the side of the car, where Al opens the door and doves fly out. ||Uh.
|-
| On &quot;baby&quot;, cut to the top of the car. ||It's all about the Pentiums, baby
|-
| Cut to the front of the car, where Al stands up along with a woman in a silver jumpsuit. After the line, two more women in silver jumpsuits get out from the back. ||It's all about the Pentiums!
|-
| The four walk towards the camera. Before &quot;Yeah!&quot;, the camera fades in to a closer shot of the fours' faces, and another woman has appeared behind them. Fade out. ||It's all about the Pentiums! Yeah!
|-
| Cut to Al, looking down towards the camera and walking down a green cubicle corridor. He moves his left hand to &quot;Whatcha wanna&quot;, and his right on &quot;do.&quot; ||Whatcha'll wanna do?
|-
| He moves his hands one after the other to the words up to &quot;hackers.&quot; On &quot;hackers&quot;, he moves his left hand to both syllables. ||Wanna be hackers?
|-
| He moves his left hand on &quot;Code crackers&quot;, and his right on &quot;slackers.&quot; ||Code crackers, slackers
|-
| Cut to a moving view of a confused woman's face, while sheworks at her computer. On &quot;chatroom&quot;, cut back to Al, standing up straight. He sings the rest of the line.||Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers
|-
| Al moves his hand behind him and wiggles his fingers. ||9 to 5 chillin' at [[Wikipedia:Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard]]
|-
| On &quot;at&quot;, cut to an orange room, with a man looking at a card. On &quot;with&quot;, he holds it up for the camera to see. It says &quot;YOU WANT IT WHEN?&quot; at the bottom, with four laughing people at the top. ||Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard
|-
| Cut back to the green corridor. Al is moving his right shoulder, then vice versa.  On &quot;with my&quot;, he changes it from right to left, to left to right. ||Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills.
|-
| On every &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, a man working in a cubicle yells the word. On &quot;thrills&quot;, Al does vice versa.||&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Defraggin' my&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; hard drive&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; for thrills&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| On &quot;gigabytes&quot;, cut to the inside of a computer, with Al's head up to the camera. He sings the line. ||I got me&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; a hundred gi&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;gabytes&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; of RAM&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeeeeaaaah!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| He moves more to the left and moves his hands along with his line. ||I never feed [[Wikipedia:Internet troll|trolls]]
|-
| He moves to the center of the screen and moves his hands with the lines. ||And I don't read [[Wikipedia:Spam (electronic)|SPAM]]
|-
| Cut to a black dancefloor in the green office. Al is in the center with his arm raised. 6 women in silver jumpsuits are dancing in the background. The camera rotates around Al. ||Installed a [[Wikipedia:Digital Signal 1|T1]] line in my house
|-
| Cut to the 6 women dancing. On &quot;double&quot;, cut back to Al, who has his arms raised in a 90 degree angle, and moves his hands while he sings the rest of the line. ||Always at my PC double clickin' on my miz-ouse
|-
| Cut to a man with large glasses ||Upgrade my system at least twice a day
|-
| Cut to back to Al and the dancers. He moves his hands while he sings. On &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Uh-huh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, an employee walks by and says the words. ||I'm strictly plug and play &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Uh-huh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| Al sings the line while moving his hands ||I ain't afraid of [[Wikipedia:Year 2000 problem|Y2K]]
|-
| Cut to an office, with Al sitting at the chair holding a phone. He dials a number. On &quot;short&quot;, he sticks his pinky up, as if saying &quot;one minute&quot;. ||I'm down with [[Wikipedia:Bill Gates|Bill Gates]], I call him money for short
|-
| The left half of the screen shows Bill Gate's office, with a black &quot;Think similar.&quot; mug next to him. &quot;Think similar&quot; is a play on [[Wikipedia:Apple Computers|Apple's]] &quot;Think different.&quot; He is writing something down. He then answers the phone. On &quot;make&quot;, he takes the phone away from him and rolls his eyes. ||I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
|-
| Cut to the hallway. Al moves his left hand down, then righ, then puts both of them behind him on the first &quot;what&quot;. ||It's all bout the Pentiums, What?
|-

|-
| Cut to the orange office. The man reaches for some White-Out off screen. He applies it to his computer screen, and smiles at the camera. ||You've got White-Out all over your screen
|-
| Cut to the inside of a computer with Al in the center. On &quot;64&quot;, he moves his head closer to the camera. On &quot;really&quot;, he moves to the left of the screen and moves his hands while he sings. ||You think your [[Wikipedia:Commodore 64|Commodore 64]] is really neat-o
|-
| Cut to Al and the dancers. He moves his hands while he sings, but stops moving his hands when he moves his head towards the camera on &quot;Dorito.&quot; ||What kinda chip you got in there? A Dorito?
|-
| The camera moves lower, so Al has to look down. ||You're using a [[Wikipedia:Intel 80286|286]]? Don't make me laugh
|-
| On &quot;Windows&quot;, cut to the cublicle of an employee, who's watching all that's going on. ||Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?

It's All About The Pentiums, baby
Uh. Uh-huh, yeah. Uh. Uh-huh, yeah.
It's All About The Pentiums, baby
Uh.
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums! Yeah!

Whatcha'll wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?
Code crackers, slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers
9 to 5 chillin' at Hewlett-Packard
Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard
Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills.
Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM
I never feed trolls
And I don't read SPAM
Installed a T1 line in my house
Always at my PC double clickin' on my miz-ouse
Upgrade my system at least twice a day
I'm strictly plug and play
Uh-huh!
I ain't afraid of Y2K
I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him money for short
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support

It's all bout the Pentiums, What?
You've got to be the dumbest noobie I've ever seen
You've got White-Out all over your screen
You think your Commodore 64 is really neat-o
What kinda chip you got in there? A Dorito?
You're using a 286? Don't make me laugh
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
You're the biggest joke on the Internet
Your database is a disaster
You're waxing your modem, tryin' to make it go faster
Hey fella! I bet you're still livin' in your parents cellar
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar

And postin' &quot;Me too&quot; like some braindead AOL-er
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller
You're just about as useless as JPEGs to Hellan Keller

It's all about the Pentiums
It's all about the Pentiums
It's all about the Pentiums, yeah!
It's all about the Pentiums

Now! Whatcha'll wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?
Code crackers, slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5 chillin' at Hewlett-Packard

Wanna run with my crew, huh?
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?
They call me the king of the spreadsheets
Got 'em all printed out on my bedsheets
My new computer's got the clocks,
it rocks, 
but it was obsolete before I opened the box
You say you've had your desktop for over a week. 
Uh-huh!
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique
Your laptop is a month old? Well that's great
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
My digital media is right protected
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
I've beta tested evry operating system
Gave props to some and others? I dissed 'em
While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'
It does all my work without me even askin'

Got a flat screen monitor 40 inches wide
I believe that yours says Etch-A-Sketch on the side
In a 32-bit world you're a 2-bit user
You've got your own newsgroup: alt-totalloser
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
Where'd you get your CPU? In a box of Cracker Jacks?
Play me online and you know that I'll beat you
If I ever meet you I'll Control-Alt-Delete you

What? What? What? What?
It's all about the Pentiums, Yeah!
It's all about the Pentiums, Yeah!
It's all about the Pentiums, Yeah!
Whatcha'll wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?
Code crackers, slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5 chillin' at Hewlett-Packard
What?

==Trivia==
*The album art is a parody of Nirvana's album Nevermind.
*In the &quot;FairlyOdd Parents&quot; episode &quot;One Man Banned&quot; there is a scene where it shows Timmy Turner on albums covers.&amp;nbsp; One of these albums is &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;.
*The Song Waffle King Was Suposed To Be On This Album, But Was Moved To Alapalooza

===Easter eggs===
After the last song, there are ten minutes of dead silence. After the ten minutes are over the song [[Song:Bite Me|Bite Me]] starts playing. This hidden track was put in to parody Nirvana's &quot;Endless Nameless&quot; and to scare listeners who forgot to turn the CD player off. It lasts about 6 seconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">This committee helps to ensure that all wiki pages validate as proper XHTML and CSS. This means stripping out bad code, replacing it with good code, and helping to educate our community on what tags can and can't be used in valid code.

== First order of business &amp;mdash; font tags ==
There are many &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags hanging out here and there. Many people are using them in their sigs. Since font tags are allowed in XHTML 1.0 Transitional, it's okay if people want to continue using them, but they should make sure to enclose the color declaration in quotation marks to keep things valid. However, we should try to switch to everyone to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #abc;&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This method is much more forward compatible.

== Firefox validation extension ==
For those who use [http://www.getfirefox.com Mozilla Firefox], there's a great extension for validating pages on the fly. It's called [http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ HTML Validator]. This should be helpful in patrolling the wiki for invalid markup, and is recommended for all validation committee members who use Firefox.

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">Welcome to the Welcoming Committee of the [[Main Page|The Weird Al Wiki]].

== Who We Are ==
The welcoming committee is a group of people who kindly greet new users and help them get started (if needed). If you want to help out, the most obvious thing you can do is post welcome messages and be friendly and helpful with new users you meet. The easiest way to see is there new is to see if they have made any 1 or 2 edits on [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] list. The new user's username or talk page will be red because they haven't been created, yet. Once you're on the user page, you can click &quot;User contributions&quot; on the sidebar to see how many edits they've done. Also be sure to check the history of the talk page to verify that no one has already welcomed them (they may have deleted the first welcome message).

Note that joining the committee confers neither responsibilities nor privileges, but members are expected to do some welcoming &amp;mdash; we don't want to simply clutter up this page with member names. 

You should also have a basic technical understanding of the wiki so that you can answer any questions an inexperienced user might have. 

== Don't Bite ==
''&quot;Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.&quot;'' -[[Wikipedia:Hanlon's Razor|Hanlon's Razor]]

The [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Welcoming Committee|Wikipedia Welcoming Committee]], in their &quot;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|Please do not bite the newcomers]]&quot; page, wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...Behavior that may appear malicious to experienced Wikipedians is more likely due to ignorance of our expectations and rules. Even if you're '''100% sure''' that someone is a ''worthless, no-good, low-down scum-sucking Internet troll,'' vandal, or worse; ''comport yourself as if they're not.'' By being forgiving, instructive, and respectful, you come away with much more dignity, and you reflect well on our project.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Basically, just don't get frustrated if a newcomer or some IP makes a mistake- let it slide and give him a friendly note telling them what they did.

== Standards for Welcoming ==

A good welcome message should be around the lines of this [[Template:welcome|template]]:

{{welcome|(your signature)|(timestamp)}}

----

To use the template, type &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome|~~~|~~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, which will automatically include your signature and a timestamp. (Typing &lt;tt&gt;subst&lt;/tt&gt; before the name of the template tells the system to copy a static version of the template to the page.)

----

Be as kind and welcoming as possible and answer any questions they might have. 

When creating your own personal template, you don't have to follow the original layout exactly. You can rearrange it and reword it, but please include the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Index MediaWiki User's Guide], [[HRWiki:Standards]], [[HRWiki:FAQ]] and [[Help:Editing]] pages within the text. Like the general welcome template, be sure to use the &lt;code&gt;subst:&lt;/code&gt; command to substitute, rather than link, your template on a user's talk page.

''(Please remember only to join if you plan to do some Welcoming)''

This template is an easy song link. Instead of typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Song:Gump|Gump]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Just type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Sl|Gump}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It comes out like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Once, there was this kid who
Took a trip to Singapore and brought along his spray paint
And when he finally came back
He had cane marks all over his bottom
He said that it was from when
The warden whacked it so hard

Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm

(*whip* sound) Ahh

Once there was this girl who
Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion
And when she finally made it
She saw some other girl who was better (*ding* sound)
And so she hired some guy to
Club her in the kneecap

Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm
(*thwack* sound) Ahh
Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm

They got paid for their sound bites
And sold their TV movie rights

And then, there was this guy who
Made his wife so mad one night that she cut off his weiner
And when he finally came to
He found that Mr. Happy was missing
He couldn't quite explain it
It'd always just been there

Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm

Ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Were), ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Is)
Ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Were), ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Is)

Ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Were), ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Is)
Ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Were), ahh ahh (There) ahh ahh (Is)

(There were, there is)
(There were, there is)


Live performances can also include:
Once, there was this girl who
Rode around in limousines and didn't wear her fundies
And when she finally cracked up
She shaved all of the hair off of her head
We couldn't understand it
It'd always just been there
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm



Once, there was this girl who
Got herself a DUI and went away to prison
And when she finally came back
She spoke with Larry King on his talk show
Can someone tell me why we
Should give a crap about her
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm


Alternate Ending:
He couldn't quite explain why
Anybody should care...) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Well, I had two weeks of vacation time coming
After working all year down at Big Roy's Heating And Plumbing
So one night when my family the I were gathered 'round the dinner table
I said, &quot;Kids, if you could go anywhere in this great big world, now
Where'd you like to go to&quot;
They said, &quot;Dad, we wanna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota&quot;
They picked the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

So the very next day we loaded up the car
With potato skins and pickled wieners,
Crossword puzzles, Spider-Man comics, and mama's home made rhubarb pie
Pulled out of the driveway and the neighbors, they all waved good-bye
And so began our three day journey

We picked up a guy holding a sign that said &quot;twine ball or bust&quot;
He smelled real bad and he said his name was Bernie
I put in a Slim Whitman tape, my wife put on a brand new hair net
Kids were in the back seat jumping up and down,
yelling &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
And all of us were joined together in one common thought
As we rolled down the long and winding interstate in our '53 DeSoto
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're headin' for the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Oh, we couldn't wait to get there
So we drove straight through for three whole days and nights
Of course, we stopped for more pickled wieners now and then
The scenery was just so pretty, boy I wish the kids could've seen it
But you can't see out of the side of the car
Because the windows are completely covered
With the decals from all the place where we've already been

Like Elvis-O-Rama, the Tupperware Museum,
The Boll Weevil Monument, and Cranberry World,
The Shuffleboard Hall Of Fame, Poodle Dog Rock,
And The Mecca of Albino Squirrels
We've been to ghost towns, theme parks, wax museums,
And a place where you can drive through the middle of a tree
Seen alligator farms and tarantula ranches,
But there's still one thing we gotta see

Well, we crossed the state line about 6:39
And we saw a sign that said &quot;Twine Ball exit - 50 miles&quot;
Oh, the kids were so happy the started singing 
&quot;99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall&quot; for the 27th time that day
So, we pulled off the road at the last chance gas station
Got a few more pickled wieners and a diet chocolate soda
On our way to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Finally, at 7:37 early Wednesday evening as the sun was setting
in the Minnesota sky
Out in the distance, on the horizon, it appeared to me like a vision 
before my unbelieving eyes
We parked the car and walked with awe-filled reverence towards that 
glorious huge majestic sphere
I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer immensity,
I had to pop myself a beer
Yes, on these hallowed grounds, open ten to eight on weekdays,
in a little shrine under a make-shift pagoda,
There sits the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I tell you, it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Oh, what on earth would make a man decide to do that kind of thing?
Oh, windin' up twenty-one thousand, one hundred forty pounds of string
What was he trying to prove? Who was he trying to impress?
Why did he build it? How did he do it? Is anybody's guess.
Where did he get the twine? What was goin' through his mind?
Did it just seem like a good idea at the time?

Well, we walked up beside it and I warned the kids
&quot;Now, you better not touch it, those ropes are there for a reason&quot;
I said, &quot;Maybe if you're good, I'll tie it to the back of our car
and we can take it home&quot;, but I was only teasin'
Then we went to the gift shop and stood in line
Bought a souvenir miniature ball of twine, some window decals,
and anything else they'd sell us
And I bought a couple post cards, &quot;Greetings from the twine ball,
wish you were here&quot;
Won't the folks back home be jealous

I gave our camera to Bernie and we stood by the ball and we all gathered
'round and said, &quot;Cheese&quot;
Then Bernie ran away with my brand new Insti-Matic,
but at least we got our memories
So, we all just stared at the ball for a while and my eyes got moist,
but I said with a smile, &quot;Kids, this here's what America's all about&quot;
Then I started feelin' kinda gooey inside and I fell on my knees
and I cried and cried
And that's when those security guards threw us out
You know, I bet if we unraveled that sucker,
It'd roll all the way down to Fargo, North Dakota
'Cause it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I'm talkin' 'bout the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Well, we stayed that night at the Twine Ball Inn
In the morning we were on our way home again
But we really didn't want to leave, that was perfectly clear
I said, &quot;Folks, I can tell you're all sad to go&quot;
Then I winked my eye and I said, &quot;You know, I got a funny kind of feelin' 
we'll be comin' back again next year&quot;
'Cause I've been all around this great big world
And I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go to 
Than the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I said the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
Minnesota 
Minnesota 
Minnesota 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Trigger happy
Trigger happy!

Got an AK-47, well you know it makes me feel alright
Got an Uzi by my pillow, helps me sleep a little better at night
There's no feeling any greater
Than to shoot first and ask questions later
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day (Trigger, happy every day)

Well, you can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right
Yeah, I gotta be ready if the Commies attack us tonight (Buh, uh, uh, uuuuh)
I'll blow their brains out with my Smith and Wesson
That ought to teach them all a darn good lesson
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day (Trigger, happy every day)

(Oh yeah, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh I'm so) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, trigger happy)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away

Oh, I accidentally shot daddy last night in the den (Shot daddy in the den)
I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again (Drug-crazed Nazi again)
Now why'd you have to get so mad?
It was just a lousy flesh wound, Dad
You know, I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day (Trigger, happy every day)

Oh, I still haven't figured out the safety on my rifle yet (Bop doo-wop shoo-wop bop doo-wop)
Little Fluffy took a round, better take him to the vet (Bop doo-wop shoo-wop bop doo-wop)
I filled that kitty cat so full of lead
We'll have to use him for a pencil instead
Well, I'm so trigger happy, trigger happy every day (Trigger, happy every day)

(Oh yeah, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh I'm so) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, trigger happy)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away

Come on and grab your ammo
What have you got to lose? (Pom pom pom pom puhhh)
We'll all get liquored up
And shoot at anything that moves!

Got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a laser sight (Shoot to kill, now, shoot to kill)
Oh, I'm prayin' somebody tries to break in here tonight (Shoot to kill, now, shoot to kill)
I always keep a Magnum in my trunk
You better ask yourself, do you feel lucky, punk?
Because I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day (Trigger, happy every day)

(Oh yeah, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
(Oh I'm so) trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, yeah, I'm trigger happy)
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy (Trigger happy, trigger happy)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away (Watch out, or he'll blow you away!)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away (Watch out, or he'll blow you away!)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away (Watch out, or he'll blow you away!)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away (Watch out, or he'll blow you away!)
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away

[[File:Iloverockyroad.jpg|thumb|300px|Single Cover.]]
I Love Rocky Road is a parody of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts cover of the Arrows I Love Rock 'n' Roll. The song is talking about Rocky Road flavoured ice cream.

Single: '''I Love Rocky Road'''
Released: '''July 5, 1983'''
Recorded: '''March 14, 1982'''
Total Running Time: '''6:01'''

==Tracks==
# [[I Love Rocky Road]]
# [[Happy Birthday]]
(Promo single doesn't include [[Happy Birthday]])

==Trivia==
*This is Weird Al's fourth single.
*It charted at no. 6 on the U.S Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles.

==Music Video (from Wikipedia)==
The music video was the directorial debut of Dror Soref and parodies the &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot; music video, with these differences from the original:
*It takes place in an ice cream parlor, rather than in a bar.
*It was shot in color rather than in black and white (although the Joan Jett original was shot in color initially).
*It was videotaped rather than filmed.
*In &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot;, Joan Jett says &quot;Ow!&quot; twice for her enthusiasm. In &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;, Weird Al says &quot;Ow!&quot; in reaction to an ice cream-induced brain freeze, the second time he says &quot;Ow!&quot; in reaction to a kid biting his leg.
*Dr. Demento makes a cameo appearance as a cashier.
*While Al is playing his accordion, the cover photo for the single can be seen.
*Yankovic wears a black leather jacket with the I Love Lucy logo, as a reference to Yankovic's first music video, &quot;Ricky&quot;.
*The ice cream in the video was actually mashed potatoes because real ice cream would melt under the stage lights.[1]
*When Yankovic sings the line &quot;If I get fat and lose my teeth, that's fine with me,&quot; he smiles to reveal all his teeth have either fallen out or are rotten.

&lt;pre&gt;
(one, two, thray, four)
(one, two [nasal hocking sound])

I used to be a pinball freak
That's where you'd find me every week
But now it's Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

I love to gobble up those dots
Keep pumpin' quarters in the slots
They call it Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

At the game arcade, they say I'm hard core
I can play all day 'til my hands are sore
And I quit my job just to play some more
But I won't give up 'til I break high score

Pacman [music from Pacman &quot;intermission&quot;]

Well it's the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

Well it takes a lot of cash to play
(Pacman, get the cherry)
So I'm gonna sell my house today
(Pacman, eat 'em up)

I'm playin' Pacman
Yeah it's the Pac-ma-an

Hey mom, I won't be home this year
(Pacman)
Please forward all my mail right here
(Pacman)
I'm at the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

And you're playing with no one but me
Pacman

[music from Pacman &quot;intermission&quot;]
[sound from when Pacman dies]

&lt;pre&gt;
I got my alligator boots, I wear my pants skin tight
I wear my dark sunglasses in the middle of the night
And when I look in the mirror, oh it's such an awesome sight
It makes me want to kneel down and pray

I'm so adorable and charming
I'm sure that you can see
And everybody's always tryin' to hang around with me
They tell me I'm the greatest, and it's hard to disagree
'Cause I'm so perfect in every way

And I'm so cute
I can hardly stand it
And I'm so handsome, honey, I could just die
I know you'll never be as wonderful as me
But at least you can try

‘Cause I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy

Baby, are you in the mood for a little romance
Well, for starters I could pour some chocolate pudding down your pants
And then attach electrodes to your brain and watch you dance
Well, golly, wouldn't that be fun

Oh, and then I might decide to tie you up with dental floss
I'll make you wear a harness, and I'll show you who's the boss
Of course, if you refuse, well honey, it's your loss
I mean, I don't do this with just anyone

So baby, how can you say its all over
So how can you tell me goodbye
So now you tell me that you're leavin' me for good
And all I wanna know is why
I mean, after all

I'm really such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy

I mean you could do worse

I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm just such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)

Baby, I tell you I'm such a groovy guy, 
I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy, such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Such a groovy guy, such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm such a groovy guy, such a groovy, groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
I'm really such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Such a groovy guy, I'm such a groovy guy (such a groovy guy)
Such a groovy guy (whoo)
Yeah

Well, hey, how ya doin', have a seat, have a drink
Boy, it's good to see you, what can I say
Whoa, sorry, gotta run, we'll get together again
Say, what was your name, anyway
Well, we're workin' on the problem
We'll get back to ya soon (yeah)
But don't try to call me
I'll be in a meeting every afternoon
For a year, maybe longer, keep in touch
Thanks for droppin' by and have a nice day

The check's in the mail (hey)
You're beautiful
Don't ever change
You know what I mean
My girl will call your girl
We'll talk, we'll do lunch
Or leave a message on my machine
So baby, won't you sign
On the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail
Would I lie to you

Well, hey, wait a minute
What's the matter, hold on
You want me to fork over the loot
You say you hate my guts
You wanna take me to court
And you got yourself a lawyer with a three-piece suit
Well, I'm proud to say you're not
The only critic of mine (yeah)
So if you wanna sue me
I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait in line
Take a number, thanks for calling
Who loves you, baby
Don't forget to read the fine print

See, the check's in the mail (hey)
You're beautiful
Don't ever change
You know what I mean
My girl will call your girl
We'll talk, we'll do lunch
Or leave a message on my machine
So baby, won't you sign
On the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail
Would I lie to you

Aw, trust me

The check's in the mail (hey)
You're beautiful
Don't ever change
You know what I mean
Why don't you leave a message with my girl
I'll have lunch with your machine
So baby, won't you sign
On the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail
Would I lie to you
The check's in the mail
Would I lie to you

Yeah
A used ... pink bathrobe
A rare ... mint snowglobe
A Smurf ... TV tray
I bought on eBay

My house ... is filled with this crap
Shows up in bubble wrap
Most every day
What I bought on eBay

Tell me why (I need another pet rock)
Tell me why (I got that Alf alarm clock)
Tell me why (I bid on Shatner's old toupee)
They had it on eBay

I'll buy ... your knick-knack
Just check ... my feedback
&quot;A++!&quot; they all say
They love me on eBay

Gonna buy (a slightly-damaged golf bag)
Gonna buy (some Beanie Babies, new with tag)
(From some guy) I've never met in Norway
Found him on eBay

I am the type who is liable to snipe you
With two seconds left to go, whoa
Got Paypal or Visa, what ever'll please
As long as I've got the dough

I'll buy ... your tchotchkes
Sell me ... your watch, please
I'll buy (I'll buy, I'll buy, I'll buy ...)
I'm highest bidder now

(Junk keeps arriving in the mail)
(From that worldwide garage sale) (Dukes Of Hazzard ashtray)
(Hey! A Dukes Of Hazzard ashtray)
Oh yeah ... (I bought it on eBay)

Wanna buy (a PacMan Fever lunchbox)
Wanna buy (a case on vintage tube socks)
Wanna buy (a Kleenex used by Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre)
(Found it on eBay)

Wanna buy (that Farrah Fawcett poster)
(Pez dispensers and a toaster)
(Don't know why ... the kind of stuff you'd throw away)
(I'll buy on eBay)

What I bought on eBay-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y

&lt;pre&gt;
(Hahaha)

(Well,) I'm not the brightest crayon in the box
Everyone says I'm dumber than a bag of rocks
I barely even know... how to put on my own pants!
But I'm a genius in France (yeah), genius in France, genius in France!

Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka

I may not be the sharpest hunk of cheese
I got a negative number on my SATs
I'm not good looking and I don't know how to dance
But nevertheless and in spite of the evidence I am still widely considered to be a
Genius in France, genius in France, genius in France!

People say I'm a geek, a moronic little freak
An annoying pipsqueak with an unfortunate physique
If I was any dumber, they'd have to water me twice a week

But when the Mademoiselles see me, they all swoon and shriek
They dig my mystique, they think I'm c'est magnifique
When I'm in Par-ee, I'm the chic-est of the chic

They love my body odor and my bad toupee
They love my stripey shirt and my stupid beret

(Bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow) And when I'm sipping on a Perrier
(Dway-doo dway-doo bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow) In some cafe down in Saint-Tropez
(Dway-doo dway-doo bow, yeah) It's hard to keep the fans at bay
They say, &quot;Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait&quot;
&quot;Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait&quot;

Hemenene humenene
Hemenene humenene
Poodle... poodle...

Folks in my hometown think I'm a fool
Got too much chlorine in my gene pool

A few peas short of a casserole
A few buttons missing on my remote control
A few fries short of a happy meal
I couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel

Instructions on the heel
Instructions on the heel

But when I'm in Provence, I get free croissants
Yeah, I'm the guy every French lady wants
And if you ask 'em why, you're bound to get this response

(He's a genius in France! Genius in France!)
That's right
(He's a genius in France! Genius in France!)
You know it
(He's a genius in France, genius in France, genius in France!)

I'm not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree
But the folks in France, they don't seem to agree
They say, &quot;Bonjour, Monsieur would you take ze picture with me?&quot;

I say, &quot;Oui, oui&quot;
That's right, I say, &quot;Oui, oui&quot;
(&quot;Oui, oui&quot;)
(He says, &quot;Oui, oui&quot;)

I'm dumber than a box of hair
But those Frenchies don't seem to care
Don't know why, mon frere
But they love me there

I'm a genius in France
(Yeah) I'm a genius in France

Gonna make a big splash when I show up in Cannes
Gonna make those Frenchies scream
&quot;You ze man! You ze man! You ze man!&quot;

Like a fine Renoir (oir!), I've got that ''je ne sais quoi'' (quoi!)
Like a fine Renoir (ooh la la), I've got that ''je ne sais''
Quoi quoi quoi quoi quoi, (bow diddy) oo-wee-oo (yeah)
Quoi quoi quoi quoi quoi, (bow diddy) oo-wee-oo (didi-di di)

Bow diddy bow di bow di bow bow diddy
Bow diddy bow di bow di bow bow diddy
Bow

[snort]

I'm a taco short of a combo plate
But by some twist of fate, all the Frogs think I'm great
Oh, the men all faint and the women scream
They like me more than heavy cream

When I'm in Versailles, I'm a popular guy
My oh my, I'm as French as apple pie (apple pie)
They think I'm awful witty, a riot and a half
When I tell a stupid joke, they laugh (haw haw haw haw haw)
And laugh (haw haw haw haw haw haw)

People in France have lots of attitude
They're snotty and rude, they like disgusting food
But when they see me, they just come unglued
They think that I am one happening dude

Bowm ba ba bowm ba bowm ba bowm
I'm about as sharp as a bowling ball
But they like me better than Charles de Gaulle

Entre nous, it's very true
The room temperature's higher than my IQ
But they love me more than Gerard Depardieu
How did this happen; I don't have a clue (yeah)

Well, I'm not the quickest tractor on the farm
I don't have any skills or grace or charm
And most people look at me like I'm all covered with ants
But I'm a genius in France (yeah), genius in France, genius in France!

And I'm never goin' back, I'm never goin' back
I'm never never never never goin' back home again
I'm tearin' up my return flight ticket
Gonna tell the folks back home where they can stick it

'Cause I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back

The girls back home never gave me a chance
But I sho' 'nuff got them Frogs in some kinda trance
And I'm aware that it's a most improbable circumstance
But Great Googily Moogily, I'm a genius in France

Every Frenchie that I meet
Just can't wait to kiss my feet
Get in line, pucker up! ''Tout de suite''!

Bowm diddy bowm diddy bowm diddy

I'm gettin' even more famous by the hour
I'm stuffed with pastries and drunk with power
Now they're puttin' up my statue by the Eiffel Tower

A little more to the left, boys, a little more to the left
A little more to the left, boys, a little more to the left

I'm the biggest dork there is alive
My mom picked out my clothes for me 'till I was 35
And I forgot to mention
I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek convention

But the Frenchies think
That my poop don't stink
I'm a genius in France

Say, would you pass the Grey Poupon?
''Merci beaucoup''
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">Hi all, there is an issue for this community.  It's been pointed out that the lyrics collection you have here is likely to be a copyright violation.  we can't have that on Wikicities, so they are going to have to be deleted.  I'm sorry about this, because I know you have put work into them, but we have to keep this legal.  Sometimes a small section of lyrics (perhaps a few lines) can be used under &quot;fair use&quot;, but the whole song can't.  So they need to be deleted I'm afraid.  Can you deal with this please?  Thanks -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 10:44, 16 March 2006 (UTC) (Wikia Community team)

::::Getting permission is a good idea, that would solve the problem nicely.  The Thing, I know other wikis and other sites do have lyrics, but that only means that they are risking trouble that we don't want to.  It's annoying that we can't use them, but hopefully Bluebry muffin will have some luck with seeking permission.

== New skin ==
Hi guys,

Several months ago, Wikia released a new site skin called Monaco which replaces the existing skin (Quartz).  The new skin features tools which make it much easier for visitors to find content and edit it.  You can read about the new skin [[w:Wikia's New Style|here]].  While you will still be able to select Quartz as the skin you personally used to view the site (via [[Special:Preferences]]), we are no longer supporting Quartz as a default skin for anonymous visitors.  This wiki still uses Quartz, so we need to change it to Monaco.  There is a similar theme in Monaco; check out how the homepage would look in Monaco [http://weirdal.wikia.com/index.php?title=Weird_Al_Wiki&amp;useskin=monaco&amp;usetheme=slate here].

Take a look at it, and let me know if you have any questions.  You can learn about customizing the menus and other aspects of Monaco [[w:c:help:Help:Customizing_Monaco|here]].

Thanks! --[[User:KyleH|KyleH]]&lt;staff /&gt; &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:KyleH|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:01, 22 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;pre&gt;
I recall the time they found those fossilized mosquitoes
And before long, they were cloning DNA
Now I'm being chased by some irate veloceraptors
Well, believe me... this has been one lousy day

Jurassic Park is frightning in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
Someone shut the fence off in the rain
I admit it's kinda eerie
But this proves my chaos theory
And I don't think I'll be coming back again
On no

I cannot approve of this attraction
'Cause getting disemboweled always makes me kinda mad
A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawer
Well, I suppose that proves... they're really not all bad

Jurassic Park is frightning in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
Someone let T. Rex out of his pen
I'm afraid those things'll harm me
'Cause they sure don't act like Barney
And they think that I'm their dinner, not their friend
Oh no

Jurassic Park is frightning in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
What a crummy weekend this has been
Well, this sure ain't no E-ticket
Think I'll tell them where to stick it
'Cause I'm never coming back this way again
Oh no... oh no
&lt;/pre&gt;

I can't watch this. I can't watch this
I can't watch this. I can't watch this

My my my my TV makes me so bored
Makes me say, oh my lord
What is this garbage here?
Wanna cover my eyes and plug my ears
It sucks, and that's no lie
It's about as much fun as watching paint dry
Lowers my IQ one notch
And that's the reason why, uh, I can't watch

I told you homeboy... I can't watch this
Yeah, nothin' but trash and you know...
I can't watch this
Poke out my eyes, man... I can't watch this
Yo, gimme that remote control... I can't watch this

Talkin' 'bout sick shows
Tere's America's Funniest Home Videos
I can't believe my eyes
When I see the kind of stuff that wins first prize
Somebody's poor old mom
Falls down off the roof, lands right on the lawn
Face first on a rake
I hear they've got it on the seventeenth take
That's funny as a kick in the crotch
And that kind of show, uh, I can't watch

Yo, I told you... I can't watch this
Change the channel now, man... I can't watch this
Yo, pass the TV Guide here, sucker... I can't watch this

Cosby Show and Rosanne
Think I've taken 'bout as much as I can
Judge Wopner, oh my
You gotta be Rainman to like this guy
Thirtysomething is alright
If you like hearing yuppies whining all night
Can't stand Twin Peaks
Wish they'd lynch those donun-eatin' freaks
Thos Siskel &amp; Ebert bums
Oughta go home and sit on their thumbs

That's word because you know... I can't watch this
I can't watch this
Break it down!

Here's-how-to-order

removes-tough-stains-fast
it-tastes-more-like-fresh-peanuts
they-keep-going-and-going
don't-hate-me-because-I'm-beautiful
could-be-dandruff
our-prices-are-insaaaane!!!

Stop! Prime Time!
I'm pretty sure I'll be sick
If I have to watch another stupid pet trick
Or that guy with the real flat hair
That goes &quot;woof woof woof&quot; and waves his fist in the air
Or those weird talk shows
About Transsexual Nazi Eskimos
They're rude, crude and vile
Just for a minute let's flip down the dial

Flip, flip, flip... yeccch, I can't watch this
Look man... I can't watch this
I can't take this torture no more, I can't...
I can't watch this
Pay the bills, station break
Break it down!

I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up!!

Stop! Cable Time!
HBO and Playboy, Showtime and MTV
I might like 'em more after my lobotomy
Now why did I ever pay for this junk?
I hooked up eighty channels and each one stunk
Just brainless blood and guts, and mindless T &amp; A
It's awful, it's putrid, it's crummy, it's stupid, gonna throw my set away

I can't watch this. I can't watch this
I can't watch this. Yeah... I can't watch this
I told you... can't watch this
Too hip, can't watch this
Get me outta here... can't watch this
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
*According to the [http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm FAQ at WeirdAl.com], There wasn't an official video for this album because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Al was actually planning to do a video for “Couch Potato” (his parody of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”). But unfortunately, even though Eminem was okay with Al having the parody on his album, for some strange reason he denied permission for Al to make a music video for the song. Since Al was already in pre-production on the video and also had to put together his AL-TV special and gear up for a 3-month concert tour, he didn’t have the time to switch gears and do a video for a different song. Al did put together a couple of makeshift videos for AL-TV (including one for the song “Bob” which was a dead-on parody of Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” from the Don’t Look Back documentary), but those were low-budget quickies that were intended to be exclusive to the VH1 special.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*When asked to identify the people on the CD cover, Weird Al recognized them as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Well, let’s see… the guy with the poodle on his head would be me. The very pregnant woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin- once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for “The Saga Begins”). UH Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay’s son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for the Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne’s oldest friends. Bermuda’s wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt’s boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Easter eggs===
*Put the disk into your computer. When it pops up hit the space bar to see a picture of Al and his wife.

You on some kind of diet? Is that what they're teaching in that little sissy school of yours?&quot; Al: &quot;Hey back off man!

==Trivia==
* This was originally going to be released with Weird Al's CD, [[Wikipedia:Straight Outta Lynwood|Straight Outta Lynwood]], but was removed after a conflict with James Blunt's record label.
** In 2009, for his upcoming CD [[The Essential &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]], he asked them again and they responded &quot;Thanks for your email, but both James and I will never approve this parody to be released on any label.&quot;
* When Al performs this song at concerts, he usually wears multiple shirts, with one that says, &quot;Atlantic Records Sucks.&quot; During one concert, he has a shirt which says &quot;Atlantic Records STILL Sucks!&quot; This is a reference to his above problems.

&lt;pre&gt;
My life is brilliant

&lt;talking&gt; What? Was I too early?
Oh, sorry
Should I
Do you wanna start over?
Or keep going?
OK.
Now? Now? &lt;/talking&gt;

My life is brilliant
Your life's a joke
You're just pathetic
You're always broke

Your homemade Star Trek uniform
Really ain't impressing me
You're suffering from delusions of
Adequacy

You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
It's true

Never had a date
That you couldn't inflate
And you smell repulsive too
What a bummer being you

Well you just can't dance
And forget romance
Everybody you know
Still calls you &quot;Farty Pants&quot;

But you'll always have a job
Well, I mean
As long as you still can work
That Slurpee machine

You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
It's true

You're half undressed
Eating chips off your chest
While you're playin' Halo 2
No one's classier than you

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
Loser

You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
It's true

Your dog would much rather
Play fetch by itself
You still live with your mom
And you're forty two

Guess you'll never grow a clue
Well, it just sucks to be you&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This song is very similar to {{W|The Rugburns}}' &quot;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glVrf7J6wss Dick's Automotive].&quot; Al gave them a special thanks on his next album, {{Al|Poodle Hat}}.

* This is &quot;Weird Al&quot;'s longest song.
* Zelda is named after the Legends of Zelda character.
* In the lyric booklet that comes with {{Al|Running With Scissors}}, the lyrics for this song are written as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
Way back when I was just a little bitty boy
living in a box under the stairs in a corner of
the basement of the house half a block down
the street from Jerry's Bait Shop... You know
the place... Well anyway, back then life was
going swell and everything was juuuuust
peachy... except of course for the undeniable
fact that every single morning my mother
would . . . you know what? The rest of these lyrics
aren't gonna fit on here. There's just no room
left. What a drag, huh? I guess we didn't plan
this out very well . . . probably should've used a
smaller font or a bigger piece of paper or some-
thing. Sorry. We all feel just horrible about this.
Well, I guess you'll just have to listen really carefully
and try to figure out the words for yourself.
Good luck.

Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz (born August 18, 1956 in Chicago, Illinois) is a drummer best known for working with the singer-songwriter [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]. The two met while recording &quot;Another One Rides The Bus&quot; at the [[Dr. Demento]] show on September 14, 1980. Shortly after, Yankovic invited Schwartz to join his band, gave him the nickname &quot;Bermuda&quot; (a play on words of tropical apparel bermuda shorts) and they have worked together ever since. Schwartz is heard and seen on all of Yankovic's albums, videos, and concerts.
he appeared in the tv show [[The Simpsons]] 
== Biography ==
Although born in Chicago, Schwartz grew up in Phoenix. He began drum lessons in 1965, and when his family moved to Los Angeles a few years later, he had decided to become a professional drummer and by the mid-1970s was drumming regularly with a few bands and doing some recording work.

In between Yankovic projects, Schwartz continues to play with other L.A.-area artists and bands and has recorded albums with Rip Masters, Jim Silvers, Ray Campi, Raymond And Scum, ApologetiX and Idle Hands

Schwartz has enjoyed a respectable online presence since 1993. He created The Official &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic Website in 1995, which later became weirdal.com, and he continues to maintain it, along with his own site and several others. He is an administrator for the World Of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic Forum, and regularly participates in various drum-related forums (such as the drummer's cafe forum) under the name &quot;bermuda&quot;.

Schwartz and his wife Leslie live in the Los Angeles area with their dog Pepper.

&quot;Headline News&quot; is a parody song by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. The song is a reworking of the Crash Test Dummies hit, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;, about three abnormal children. &quot;Headline News&quot;, in jest, is about three news stories of the mid 1990s: Singapore caning American delinquent Michael Fay, Tonya Harding's boyfriend beating her figure-skating rival Nancy Kerrigan, and Lorena Bobbitt removing her husband's penis (although &quot;weiner&quot; and &quot;Mr. Happy&quot; are used as euphemisms) with a knife.

The song was never officially released on a studio album and is only available as a CD single, the cover of which is a parody of the Crash Test Dummies album, ''God Shuffled His Feet''. The song does appear on Yankovic's ''Greatest Hits Volume II'' album and a box set entitled ''Permanent Record: Al In The Box''.

Yankovic's Straight Outta Lynwood concert tour contains new lyrics as part of the medley, referencing Britney Spears, dealing with her 2007 head-shaving shock and underpants-less limousine trip in late 2006, and Paris Hilton, detailing her trip to prison.

==Trivia==
* The manualist is the same as in &quot;I Love Rocky Road.&quot;
* Dr. Demento makes an appearance as one of the concert attendees leaving at the end with the large woman in a muumuu.</text>

[[Image:Headline_news.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Weird Al in a screen capture from the video]]
The [[music video]] for &quot;Headline News&quot; parodies the &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; video. The video uses the original video's theme of telling each news story as a one act play on stage before an audience of people. The video is included on &quot;Weird Al&quot;'s DVD ''[[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection]]''.

==Trivia==
* The manualist is the same as in &quot;I Love Rocky Road.&quot;
* Dr. Demento makes an appearance as one of the concert attendees leaving at the end with the large woman in a muumuu.



*Both videos feature a little person handing out programs, but in the Yankovic version, the person is shirtless
*Yankovic appears as Brad Roberts, the Crash Test Dummies lead vocalist.
*Al, throughout the video, parodies Brad Roberts' rather peculiar facial expressions.
*The video features several cameos, including an appearance by Doug Llewelyn of The People's Court fame, and long time radio show host, and Yankovic supporter, [[Dr. Demento]].[http://www.weirdal.com/videtc.htm www.weirdal.com &quot;Video Facts&quot;]
*The gate that Michael Fay steps off has the number '27' on it, a number which Yankovic often hides somewhere in his music, videos, or albums.
*Michael Fay sprays paint in the face of a Singaporean.
*During the shot of the Singapore prison, a hockey stick can be seen hanging on the wall of instruments of torture.  This is possibly a reference to the fact that the Crash Test Dummies came from Canada.
*In the middle of the video, [[Rubén Valtierra]] is seen wearing a wig while playing the piano, an obvious jest at [[Ellen Reid]], the main keyboard player for the Crash Test Dummies.
*The book that Michael Fay supposedly wrote was called &quot;Ouch! My Butt!&quot; and had a picture of him pointing to his afflicted area. He also 'signs' the books by spraying spraypaint on the inside jacket.
*[[Judy Tenuta]] is uncredited as [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]].
*John Bobbitt is evidently clueless as to where his penis is, searching inside his refrigerator.  He pulls out a pack of frankfurters, stares at them for a second, and tosses them aside with a despondent look on his face.
*At one point in the video, a [[velvet painting|velvet picture]] of Elvis Presley is seen hanging on the wall. This is likely a reference to the song &quot;Velvet Elvis&quot; from Yankovic's album [[Even Worse]].
*The second time Al hums, black duct tape can be seen taped over his mouth.
*As Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fight on the ice skating rink, four judges each hold up a sign, saying &quot;9.7,&quot; &quot;8.3,&quot; &quot;9.4,&quot; and &quot;7.6.&quot;  Also, while Harding is beating Kerrigan up on the ground, it is clearly seen that Harding is fighting a dummy.
* If you sum the first two judge signs (9+7=16 (8+3=11 (16+11))), you get [[27]].
*As Tonya Harding is at a news conference sobbing her story, Kerrigan comes, shoves her out of the way, and mouths the words &quot;Why me?&quot; before Harding pulls her down.
*Near the end, the camera moves to a different viewpoint. Al, still humming, leans back on his stool to remain in view and eventually falls off. Manualist &quot;Musical Mike&quot; Keifer can be seen on a platform above him.
*At the end of the &quot;play,&quot; the main players, all holding hands, take a bow.  Afterwards, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, who are right next to each other, shake their hands loose.
*At the end of the video, Yankovic's hair becomes a little less styled, and he is playing his accordion.
*As the video closes, instead of parents as in the original video, odd couples are seen leaving; an insane man with a dog puppet on his hand with an attractive woman, an elderly upper class man ([[Dr. Demento]]) with a lower class overweight woman with curlers, a man with a &quot;punk&quot; girlfriend, and [[Doug Llewelyn]] with a large sumo wrestler wearing an unbuttoned shirt.
*Even though in the video the man hits Nancy Kerrigan's right knee, at the end when all of the characters are on stage you see that her left knee is the one that's bandaged.

== Music video ==
The filmed music video is mostly in black and white and parodies the I Love Lucy television show. Yankovic plays the part of Ricky Ricardo, complete with effected Cuban accent. Yankovic appears minus his mustache, and with his hair slicked back, to more closely resemble Desi Arnaz. Yankovic is also seen briefly in one scene, as himself with his band, playing the accordion and sporting his normal mustache and curly hair. Tress MacNeille plays the part of Lucy, giving an impression of Lucille Ball's somewhat raspy voice and her usual schticks such as her unique way of crying. The video (and song) ends with a segment of the I Love Lucy theme, with Ricky on accordion, followed by Ricky doing his &quot;Huah! Huah! Huah!&quot; trademark laugh. This was Yankovic's first music video. The liner notes in The Ultimate Video Collection (a compilation DVD) suggest that Ricky &quot;was arguably the first comedy video ever shown on MTV&quot; (it was first seen on an episode of Saturday Night Live).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1318">Song: '''Bite Me'''

Running Time: '''0:06'''

Year: '''1992'''

Album: '''{{Al|Off The Deep End}}''' (CD Only)

Parody of: '''{{W|Endless, Nameless}} by {{W|Nirvana}}'''

Video: '''None'''

Listen/Download: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLAsXTBVjXc Here]

Bite Me is a 1992 noise song by Weird Al and yet a parody of Nirvana's &quot;Endless Nameless&quot; and is a hidden track on Off The Deep End. After &quot;You Don't Love Me Anymore&quot;, there are 10 minutes of dead silence. Bite Me has also appeared on the Weird Al Show, but was sized down to 3 seconds.

==Song==
'''Bite Me''' features backwards drumming, guitar feedback (actually guitar screeching), and Al screaming (although originally thought to be at the top of his lungs) like he's screaming at someone.

==Backmasked Message==
The six-second snippet is also the base of a backmasked message (somewhat). When the song is reversed and slowed down 800%, there is a hidden song inserted. The lyrics are faint but clearly audible at 17 seconds (of the slowed down version) the lyrics are:

''When we cannot ask the forest for a moment's shade''

''Though every ray of sun cuts like a razorblade''

''And we cannot ask the river for water''

''If she has none!''

This was discovered in 2004, and appear to be from David Hallyday's &quot;Tears of the Earth.&quot;

Ooh, my little hungry one, hungry one
Open up a package of my bologna
Ooh, I think the toast is done, the toast is done
Top it with a little of my bologna

Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo
M-m-m-my bologna

Spreadin' on the mustard now, show me how
Spread it on a little of this bologna
Hopin' that we don't run out, don't run out
If we do I'm sure that I'll miss bologna

Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna

(belch)

Goin' to the market now, market now
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer
Walkin' down the shopping isles, shopping isles
Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer

Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my, yi, yi, woo
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat
A million people every day are starving in the street

Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four
There's garbage in the water
There's poison in the sky
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

Well, what's the matter little friend, you think this party is the pits
Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose
Their finger's on the button, all they need it an excuse

It doesn't take a military genius to see
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide
When they drop the big one, we all get fried

(Come on boys and girls, sing along, ok?)

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
wow! (background screaming and sound effects)

Well there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed

I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
wow!

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

(Happy Birthday!)

And a pinch to grow an inch!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Had to park my car for just five minutes
I had to go inside to use the phone
When I came back again, my car was gone, well
I didn't know it was a loading zone
What a bummer, I as so brought down
I had to chase that tow truck all over town, yellin'

Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around

Took my baby to the local disco
I was jumpin' like a maniac
But the owner came and pulled me off the floor
Then he took me to his little office in the back

He said, I really like your snaggletooth necklace
Your pants are groovy and your hair's okay
But, man, that car of yours is so uncool
Like wow, I'm sorry, but we towed it away

Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around

Now I'm at home, I'm watchin' &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot;
Guess it's time to trade my old car in
For twenty dollars and my '64 Plymouth
Maybe I could get a second-hand Schwinn

Look out the window, there's a
Tow truck in the driveway
I grabbed the driver and I asked him why
He said, I'm sorry, kid, you're late with the payments
It's time to kiss your little car goodbye

Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around
Stop draggin' my car around

Listen, the check's in the mail, no really
Stop draggin' my car around
Oh man, I just had the hub caps painted
Stop draggin' my car around
Hey, hey, I left m sandwich in the back seat
Stop draggin' my car around
Oh
Stop draggin' my car around&lt;/pre&gt;

Gonna tell you a story
About Chuck and Diane
Couple British kids from
The palace at Buckingham

Chuckie wants to grow up
And be a polo star
And ride his little horsies
All around the backyard, oh yeah

You know they really paid their dues
I said hey, lawdy mama
They got them Buckingham blues

Now Chuckie goes hunting
And leaves Diane alone
So she fixes her hair
And she talks on the Princess Phone

Chuckie's still tryin' to figure out
What his job's supposed to be
And Diane's the fashion leader
Of the aristocracy

I said hey, Lady Di
Tell me where'd you get them shoes, ah
Well, hey nonny nonny
Looks like you got them Buckingham blues

Aw, bein' heir to the throne, well
It must be awful hard
Gotta pose for pictures
Out on the front yard

And Lady Di, well
She must have it pretty rough
Gotta hang around the house all day
Makin' babies and stuff

Another game of croquet
Then they're off on a Caribbean cruise
Well hey bop-a-re-bop
They really got them Buckingham blues

Ah, tell the truth, now, tell the truth
Wow

I got my mojo workin'
yeah, woo, don't help me now
Ah, hurt me mama, whoa, ah

They don't serve no Twinkies
With their afternoon tea
Never had a dinner
Made by Chef Boyardee

Bein' in the spotlight
Is a hard life to choose
Diane drops half a pound
It's on the six o'clock news, oh yeah

Those kids have really paid their dues
Oh, what a royal pain it is
When you got them Buckingham blues
&lt;/pre&gt;

Coming this Christmas to a theater near you
The most horrifying film to hit the screen
There's a homicidal maniac who finds a Cub Scout troop
And he hacks up two or three in every scene

Please don't reveal the secret ending to your friends
Don't spoil the big surprise
You won't believe your eyes when you see

Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell
In 3-D

Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell
In 3-D

See severed heads that almost fall right in your lap
See that bloody hatchet coming right at you
No, you'll never see hideous effects like these again
‘Till we bring you &quot;Nature Trail To Hell Part 2&quot;

So bring the kids along, it's good clean family fun
What have you got to lose
If you like the six o'clock news then you'll love
Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell
Nature Trail To Hell

I was waiting in the express lane with my twelve items or less
At the checkout counter at the local grocery store
I was only passin' by
But a paper caught my eye
And I learned a few things I never knew before

It said your pet may be an extra terrestrial
It said the ghost of Elvis is living in my den
You can learn to cope with stress
You can beat the IRS
And the incredible frog boy is on the loose again

Oh, Mignight Star
It's in the weekly Midnight Star
Aliens from outer space are sleeping in my car
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know

Eat jelly donuts and lose twenty pounds a day
Hear the story of the man born without a head
And top psychics all agree
That the telephone company
Will have a brand new service that lets you talk to the dead

Oh, Midnight Star
You can believe it if you read it in the weekly Midnight Star
They're keeping Hitler's brain alive inside a jar
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know

Tell me, tell me, tell me how to make my bust-line grow
Midnight Star, I wanna know

Ooo, Midnight Star
Well, don't you know that I read it, I read it in the weekly Midnight Star
The UFOs have landed and we'll tell you where they are
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know

Midnight Star
Well, you can read all about in in the weekly Midnight Star
You can use your ESP to learn to play guitar
I wanna know, I wanna know

(Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(Ah, Midnight Star) Inquiring minds like mine wanna know

(You can read it {x5}, Midnight Star {x2}) (Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(You can read it {x5}, Midnight Star {x2}) (Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(You can read it {x5}, Midnight Star {x2}) (Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know
(You can read it {x5}, Midnight Star {x2}) (Ah, Midnight Star) I wanna know, I wanna know

We all used to call him Jimmy the Geek
He was a dumb lookin' scrawny little four-eyed freak
He never used to hang around with the guys
He'd just sit in the corner attractin' the flies
He wasn't much to look at
He never was very bright
But at least there was one thing that he could do all right

That boy could dance
That boy could dance, yeah

He was kind of a jerk, he was kind of a bore
But the women would scream when he walked in the door
'Cause one thing I can tell you for sure
That boy could dance

Pickin' teams, he would always be last
He couldn't run very far, he couldn't think very fast
If he was on your side, you'd always lose
That guy had a problem even tyin' his shoes

He never passed a driver's test
He was always afraid of cars
And he had a complexion that resembled the surface of Mars

But that boy could dance
That boy could dance, yeah

Well, his hair was a mess, and his clothes didn't fit
He'd smell pretty bad, and he'd drool just a bit
But you got to admit
Boy, that boy could dance

Now that boy is much older
He got his own dance studio
He got a teeny bopper fan club
Yeah, he got his own TV show
Now he owns half of Montana
They all call him Diamond Jim
And you know I'd do anything if I could be just like him

'Cause that boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance, dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance, yeah
That boy could dance
I said, I said that boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance, dance

Fat and weak, what a disgrace
Guess the champ got too lazy
Ain't gonna fly now, he's just takin' up space
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain

But he's no bum, he works down the street
He bought the neighborhood deli
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat
Come inside, maybe you'll hear him say

Try the rye or the kaiser
They're on special tonight
If you want, you can have an appetizer
You might like our salami and the liver's all right
And they'd really go well with the rye
Or the kaiser

Never eats while on the job
He heard it's good to stay hungry
But he makes a pretty mean shishkabob
Have a taste, they were made fresh today

Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer
Stay away from the tuna, it smells funny tonight
But you just can't go wrong with the rye
Or the kaiser

So today, his deli comes first
Still he dreams of his past days of glory
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst
All the while you can still hear him say

It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite
Let me please be your catering adviser
If you want substitutions I won't put up a fight
You can have your roast beef on the rye
Or the kaiser

The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser

Oh-oh-oh-oh

I was there to match my intellect on national TV
Against a plumber, oh, and an architect, both with a PhD
I was tense, I was nervous, I guess it just wasn't my night
Art Fleming gave the answers
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right, -ight, -ight

I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)

Well, I knew I was in trouble now
My hope of winning sank
Oh, 'cause I got the Daily Double now
And then my mind went blank
I took Potpourri for one hundred
And then my head started to spin
Well, I'm givin' up Don Pardo
Just tell me now what I didn't win, yeah, yeah

I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)

Don Pardo: That's right, Al--You lost.
And let me tell you what you didn't win: 
a twenty volume set of the 
Encyclopedia International, a case of Turtle
Wax, and a year's supply of Rice-A-Roni, 
the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all.
You also made yourself look like a jerk in 
front of millions of people. You brought 
shame and disgrace to your family name for 
generations to come. You don't get to come
back tomorrow. You don't even get a lousy
copy of our home game. You're a complete loser!

Al:
Don't know what I was thinkin' of
I guess I just wasn't too bright
Well, I sure hope I do better
Next weekend on The Price Is Right, -ight, -ight

I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oooh)
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="599">When the song is reversed on sound recorder, and slowed down 3 times (about 800%, or 300% in Microsoft Sound Recorder), there is a hidden song inserted. The song was confirmed to be [[Wikipedia:David Hallyday|David Hallyday]]'s &quot;[[Wikipedia:Tears of the Earth|Tears of the Earth]]&quot;. The lyrics are faint but cleary audible at 0:17 (of the slowed down version) the lyrics are:

&lt;pre&gt;When we cannot ask the forest for a moment's shade

Though every ray of sun cuts like a razorblade

And we cannot ask the river for water

If she has none! &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Little ditty
'Bout Homer and Marge
Her heart was as big
As his stomach was large

Oh yeah
They say love goes on
Long after the grilled cheese sandwich is gone
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lyrics during credits:
&lt;pre&gt;
That's the story
'Bout Homer and Marge
Two folks I helped out
For a nominal charge

After Homer went gay
They patched up their schism
But the dude never dealt with
His alcoholism

Weird Al sayin'...

Oh yeah
The credits go on
Long after the viewer's interest is gone

Oh yeah
Weird Al had fun on this show
Even if it was just a brief cameo
&lt;/pre&gt;

At 2m23s in the video, just before Al buys the Star Wars Christmas Special in the alley, he walks in front of a dumpster with a lambda spray painted on it. In Half-Life 2, a spray-painted lambda indicates the presence of a hidden item cache for your character. Coincidence, or a shout-out?</text>

&lt;pre&gt;
They see me mowin' my front lawn
I know they're all thinkin' I'm so
White and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy
Look at me I'm white and nerdy

I wanna roll with the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too
White and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&amp;D
M.C. Escher, that's my favorite M.C.
Keep you're 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library

My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my top eight spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a wiz at Minesweeper, I could play for days
Once you've see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze

There's no killer app I haven't run (run)
At Pascal, well I'm number one (one)
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat, but I got a soldering gun (what?)
Happy Days is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon

Here's the part I sing on...

They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm
White and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy
Look at me I'm white and nerdy

I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too
White and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy

I been browsin', inspectin' X-Men comics
You know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect them
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shoppin' online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you R-O-T-F-L-O-L

I got a business doing websites (websites)
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop - hope no one sees me gettin' freaky

I'm nerdy in the extreme
Whiter than sour cream
I was in AV club and glee club
And even the chess team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was &quot;Do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?&quot;
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

They see me strollin', they're laughin'
And rollin' their eyes cause I'm so
White and nerdy

Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy

I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But oh well, it's obvious I'm
White and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me I'm white and nerdy
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Down in the workshop all the elves were makin' toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye,
&quot;Merry Christmas to all - now you're all gonna die!&quot;

The night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, &quot;It tastes just like chicken!&quot;

The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole
Without steppin' in reindeer guts

There's the National Guard and the F.B.I.
There's a van from the Eyewitness News
And helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky
And the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin'
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?
My my my my my my
You used to be such a jolly guy

Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doin' time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Clause, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights

They're talkin' bout - the night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped

Woah, the night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he's gettin' a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Woah, something finally must have snapped in his brain
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brain
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This was produced in 1996 meanwhile the normal version was in 1994.
* The only differences between this version and the other is that the elves don't get jobs at the end and Santa is killed instead of just going to jail.

==Trivia==
* This song’s music video won a Grammy.
* Vince Patterson, who played gang leader in this song’s music video, also played a gang leader in the original. He is also the choreographer.
* Rick Derringer plays the solo part during the bridge, which ends with an explosion due to it being shorter than the solo played by Eddie Van Halen for the original.
* The video also has a parody of ''[[Wikipedia:Thriller_(song)|Thriller]]'' at the end, when Weird Al has the zombie &quot;cat eyes&quot; that Michael Jackson has at the end of his video.

&lt;pre&gt;
How come you're always such a fussy young man
Don't want no Captain Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well, don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan
So eat it, just eat it

Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate
Don't want to hear about what kind of food you hate
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off your plate
So eat it

Don't you tell me you're full
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it
Just eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it, ooh

Your table manners are some cryin' shame
You're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now, if you starve to death, you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it, just eat it

You better listen, better do what you're told
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down or it's gonna get cold
So eat it

I don't care if you're full
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt, have some more spam
It doesn't matter it it's fresh or canned
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it

Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
If it's gettin' cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner, have a light snack
If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it (oh lord)
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Don't you make me repeat it (oh no)
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==

* This song is about a [[Nerds|nerd]].

* This song mentions [[Star Trek]], more specifically Kirk and Picard.

* {{W|Seth Green}} makes a cameo in the music video as the guy that presents Al's action figures.

* The video Al received was a bootleg copy of the [[Star Wars]] Holiday Special.
*  When Al is &quot;playing&quot; {{W|Minesweeper (video game)}}, he uses the keyboard, but you can't use the keyboard to play Minesweeper. 
* Al uses his laptop in the shower, and in [[I'll Sue Ya]], he complains about using a computer in the bathtub, and it not working anymore.

* His myspace says he has has [[27]] friends, referring to a number that happens commonly in his songs. * Here is the MySpace page used for the song: [http://www.myspace.com/whiteandnerdy] *

[[File:220px-White_Nerdy_YOU_SUCK_cropped.jpg|thumb|Al giving his opinion on Atlantic Records on Wikipedia]]

*The trivia card Al holds up in the video, but quickly pulls away reads:
**G: In what city is the largest ball of twine built by one man?
**E: What's the deal with Lindsey Lohan? I mean, seriously?
**H: F.D.R. - was he faking it?
**AL: On what page does Harry Potter die in the next book?
**SN: What is the melting point of a gorilla's head?
**(Unknown): How many Wicket Men are there on a 43-Men Squamish Team?

*Donny Osmond makes a cameo playing the man dancing behind Al when he is in front of the &quot;all white&quot; background. Al chose him because Donny was &quot;the whitest guy I [Al] could think of.&quot;

*When Al gets a wedgie, the name reads &quot;Alfred&quot;, which is Weird Al's real name.

*The song is the first mention of [[wikipedia:|Wikipedia]]. In the music video, Weird Al blanks the page on Atlantic Records using 80pt Impact font, which is impossible. It also inspired many wiki vandals to do the same.

&lt;pre&gt;
Put down your chainsaw and listen to me
It's time for us to join in the fight
It's time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys
It's time to let the bedbugs bite

You better put all your eggs in one basket
You better count your chickens before they hatch
You better sell some wine before it's time
You better find yourself an itch to scratch

You better squeeze all the Charmin you can while Mr. Wimpole's not around
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan

Talk with your mouth full
Bite the hand that feeds you
Bite on more than you chew
What can you do
Dare to be stupid

Take some wooden nickels
Look for Mr. Goodbar
Get your mojo working now
I'll show you how
You can dare to be stupid

You can turn the other cheek
You can just give up the ship
You can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip

Dare to be stupid
Come on and dare to be stupid
It's so easy to do
Dare to be stupid
We're all waiting for you
Let's go

It's time to make a mountain out of a molehill
So can I have a volunteer
There's no more time for crying over spilled milk
Now it's time for crying in your beer

Settle down, raise a family, join the PTA
Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet
And party 'till you're broke and they drive you away
It's OK, you can dare to be stupid

It's like spitting on a fish
It's like barking up a tree
It's like I said you gotta buy one if you wanna get one free

Dare to be stupid (yes)
Why don't you dare to be stupid
It's so easy to do
Dare to be stupid
We're all waiting for you
Dare to be stupid

Burn your candle at both ends
Look a gift horse in the mouth
Mashed potatoes can be your friends

You can be a coffee achiever
You can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver
The future's up to you
So what you gonna do

Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
What did I say
Dare to be stupid
Tell me, what did I say
Dare to be stupid
It's alright
Dare to be stupid
We can be stupid all night
Dare to be stupid
Come on, join the crowd
Dare to be stupid
Shout it out loud
Dare to be stupid
I can't hear you
Dare to be stupid
OK, I can hear you now
Dare to be stupid
Let's go, Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
&lt;/pre&gt;

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

Couldn't think of any lyrics
No I never wrote the lyrics
So I'll just sing any old lyrics
That come to mind, child

You really need words
Whole lotta rhyming words
You gotta rhyme so many words, mm-mm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right, child

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

I know that you're probably sore
'Cause I didn't write any more
I just didn't get to complete it
So that's why I gotta repeat it

This song is just six words long (six words long)
This song is just six words long (six words long)

Oh I make a lotta money
They pay me a ton of money
They're payin' me plenty of money
To sing this song, child

I gotta fill time
Three minutes worth of time
Oh, how will I fill so much time, mm-mm
I'll throw in a solo, a solo, a solo
A solo, a solo here

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

This song's got nothin' to say
But I'm recording it anyway
I know if I put my mind to it
I know I could find a good rhyme here

Oh, you gotta have-a music
You need really catchy music
This song has got plenty of music
But just six words, child

And so I'll sing' em over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over, mm-mm
And over and over and over
And over and over and over again

Six words long, six words long
Six words long, six words long
Six words long, six words long

This song is just six words long
It's just six words long
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's something weird in the fridge today
I don't know what it is
Food I can't recognize
My roommate won't throw a thing away
I guess it's probably his
It looks like it's alive...

And livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge
Livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge

There's something gross in the fridge today
It's green and growin' hair
It's been there since July
If you can name the object
In that baggie over there
Then mister, you're a better man than I

It's livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Can't tell what (dysentery) it is at all (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge

Tell me, do you think it should be carbon dated
Fumigated or cremated and buried at sea?
You try to save a little bit of you're home cookin'
Couple weeks later, got a scary-lookin' specimen
It always happens my friend
Again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again

Somethin' stinks in the fridge today
And it's been rottin' there all week
It could be liver cake or wooly mammoth steak
Well, maybe I should another peek...

Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Can't tell what (dysentery) it is at all (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is at all
Livin' in the fridge, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Put down your remote control
Throw out your TV Guide
Put away your jacket
There's no need to go outside
Don't you know that we control the horizontal
We control the vertical, too
We gonna make a couch potato out of you
That's what we gonna do now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF

Disconnect the phone and leave the dishes in the sink
You better put away your homework
Prime time ain't no time to think
All you do is make yourself a TV dinner
Press your face right up against the screen
We gonna show you thangs you ain't ever seen
If you know what I mean, now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF

You can watch us all day
You can watch us all night
You can watch us any time that you please
You can sit around and stare at the picture tube
'Till your brain turns into cottage cheese
Well, now

Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers
Stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry
Forget about your job
Just crank up the volume
And yank off the knob
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (we got it all)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (we got it all)
We got it all (we got it all) on UHF (we got it)
(We got it) we got (we got it) it all (we got it) on UHF (we got it all)
We got it all on UHF (we got it all)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all (we got it all) on UHF (on UHF)
We got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all (we got it all) on UHF (we go it)
We got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF (UHF)
We got it all on UHF

Lyrics:

:Watch this

:::These are my confessions
:::Just when I thought I said all I can say
:::I came up with more secrets to tell you today

::These are my confessions
::Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
::So now I gotta give you part three of my confessions

:First I told you 'bout the skank that I was cheatin' with (with)
:Then I mentioned she's havin' my kid
:That's not all, now I recall more, you see
:So now I'll give you part three of my confessions

:Now this goin' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
:Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two
:Like, remember when I told you that I knew Pauley Shore, Pauley Shore
:That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for

:I borrowed your Chap Stick from you without asking
:Oh, and I tried out your nose hair trimmer too
:And by the way, that &quot;diamond&quot; ring is cubic zirconium
:I killed your goldfish accidentally, just replaced it with another one

:::These are my confessions
:::Just when (oh) I thought I said all (oh) I can say
:::I need to get some (yeah yeah) things off my chest right away

::These are my confessions (these are my confessions)
::Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
::Now I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions, oh, oh

:Threw up on your dog the last time I had too much to drink
:There've been times I've peed in your sink
:Don't know why (don't know why, no) but you and I (ah) should agree (ah)
:That blongs in part three of my confessions

:Baby forgive me, I'm still trying to figure out
:Why I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grout
:Oh, and sometimes in private, really like to dress up like Shirley Temple
:And spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)

:My boss thinks I'ma a jerk, didn't get that raise
:I haven't changed my underwear in twenty seven days
:And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you're a midget
:I'm so sorry Debbie - I mean Bridget

:::These are my confessions
:::Just when (oh) I thought I said all I can say
:::I got a few (got a few more) more secrets I'd like to convey

::These are my confessions
::Slipped my mind (my mind) the last two times (my mind), silly me (silly me)
::Now I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions, oh, oh

:Gave you buttered toast I dropped and picked up off the floor
:FYI (I), it was not a cold sore (not a cold sore)
:Whoops, my bad (hope you're not sore at me)
:You'll be madder (ah) at me (ah) when I (even more mad, yeah, baby) finish part :three of my confessions

:''You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this''
:''But you remember that shirt you got me for my birthday?''
:''Ahh, well, I returned it for store credit''
:''That thing was hideous; what were you thinking?''
:''Oh, by the way, I wasn't really sick last week''
:''I just didn't want to go to your stupid office picnic''
:''Oh, and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of Rice Krispies?''
:''What I meant was, there was only enough left for me, sorry''

:::These are my confessions
:::Just when I thought I said all I can say
:::I thought of some more things that should scare you away

::These are my confessions
::Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
::I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions

:Once I blew my nose and then I wiped it on your cat (cat)
:And I lied - yes, that dress makes you look fat
:Anyway, I shouldn't say anymore
:'Til I give you part four of my confessions

:''I mean, I'm just getting started here''
:''I'm not even halfway down the list''
:''This thing could go on for...''
:''Hey hey, where you goin'?''
:''Honey?''
:''What?''
:''Was it something I said?''
:''Women...''

&lt;pre&gt;
Rock the cradle of love. Rock the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love
Don't rock easy, it's true
Rock the cradle of love
I rocked the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love
Don't rock easy, it's true

Doo doo doo doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doodoo doo
(Doo doo doo doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doodoo doo)

The Love Shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack, baby
(Love Shack, baby, Love Shack)
Hey!

Pump up the jam (hey!). Pump up the jam (hey!)
Pump up the jam, pump it up!

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion
Trying to keep a view
And I don't know if I can to it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelieveable
(Oh!)

Do me, baby. Do me, baby
You can do me in the morning, you can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
Yodalodaladyhoo!

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the Hump
Do me, baby
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Do me, baby
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump

She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face ten miles wide
Look so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie-yi-yi
Woo!

Drum solo!

I miss you so much (M-O-I miss you so much)
I really miss you much (M-I-S-S you so much)
I miss you so much (M-O-I miss you so much)
I really miss you much

Hey, I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Oh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes you fell all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein

Let's kick it!
If you got a problem, (yo!) I'll solve it
Check out the beat while the DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby... Word to your mother!
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby forever
I'll be your ife... ice... baby!
Hey!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Weird Al: Well, the sun is still high in the afternoon sky, but the morning seems 
so long ago. I was happy before and I'm not anymore, though why there's a change,
I don't know.

Kate: I'm so tired of this day, and I don't want to play, and I don't want a story to 
read. But I look in your eyes, and at once realize, that I know what it is-

Weird Al: Yes I know what it is

Both: Now I know what it is that I need... I need a nap!

Kate: I just can't take anymore

Both: I need a nap!

Weird Al: Can't stay awake anymore

Both: No more running around I just need to lie down and sleep.

Weird Al: I don't know what to do, I just can’t make it through, I want something or
nothing right now.

Kate: I am mad and upset. What I want I don't get. I don't know what I want, anyhow.

Weird Al: I've been doing my best, now I just want to rest. On the rug, on the floor,
I don't care.

Kate: Now the feeling's so strong, but this song is too long, it's the wrong kind of
song and it seems to be going nowhere.

Both: Nowhere! Oh, I need a nap! I just can't take anymore! I need a nap!
Can't stay awake anymore! No more running around I just need to lie down and
sleep. Let me sleep! There are times in the day when the going gets tough. When
you just have to say you've done more than enough.

Weird Al: I can't think of more stuff that will rhyme with enough.

Both: So enough is enough. Is enough is enough. Is enough is enough is
enough is enough is enough is enough is-- I need a nap!

Weird Al: Why does this song go on?

Both: I need a nap!

Weird Al: When all my strength is gone?

Both: I need a nap!

Kate: Please let me close my eyes.

Both: I need a nap! I don't wanna-- harmonize-- with you-- with me--

Weird Al: Change key!! 

(Kate: Make him stop!!)

Both: I need a nap! I just can't take anymore. I need a nap!

Weird Al: Can't stay awake anymore!! (Kate: Aaaugh!)

Both: You can follow my lead as this song loses speed, now I need an immediate nap!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Isn't it strange
Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror
What would people say
If only they knew that I was

Part of some geneticist's plan (plan-plan-plan)
Born to be a carbon copy man (man-man-man)
There in a petri dish late one night
They took a donor's body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say

I think I'm a clone now
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

Look at the way
We go out walking close together
I guess you could say
I'm really beside myself

I still remember how it began (gan-gan-gan)
They produced a carbon copy man (man-man-man)
Born in a science lab late one night
Without a mother or a father, just a test tube and a womb with a view

I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
And I can stay at home while I'm out of town
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
'Cause every pair of genes is a hand-me-down

Signing autographs for my fans
Come and meet the carbon copy man
Livin' in stereo, it's all right
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza so I say

I think I'm a clone now
Another one of me's always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
I've been on Oprah Winfrey - I'm world renowned
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
And every pair of genes is a hand-me-down

I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
That's my genetic twin always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Faces filled with joy and cheer
What a magical time of year
Howdy ho, it's Weasel Stomping Day

Put your viking helmet on
Spread that mayonnaise on the lawn
Don't you know it's Weasel Stomping Day
(Weasel Stomping Day)

All the little girls and boys
Love that wonderful crunching noise
You'll know what this day's about
When you stomp a weasel's guts right out

So come along and have a laugh
Snap their weaselly spines in half
Grab your boots and stomp your cares away
Hip hip hooray, it's Weasel Stomping Day

People up and down the street
Crushing weasels beneath their feet
Why we do it, who can say?
But it's such a festive holiday

So let the stomping fun begin
Bash their weaselly skulls right in
It's tradition - that makes it OK
Hey everyone, it's weasel stomping...
We'll have some fun on weasel stomping...
Put down your gun, it's Weasel Stompiong Day

Hip hip hooray
It's Weasel Stomping Day
Weasel Stomping Day
Hey!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Spam in the place where I live (ham and pork)
Think about nutrition, wonder what's inside it now (oh boy)
Spam in my luchbox at work (it's the best)
Really makes a darn good sandwich any way you slice it at all

If you're running low, go to the store
Carry some money to help you buy more
The tab is there to open the can
The can is there to hold in the spam

Oh, spam on the table at home (ham and pork)
Think about selection, are there different flavors now (let's eat)
Spam in my office at work (it's the best)
Think about the stuff its made from, wonder if it's mystery meat

If you need a spoon, keep one around
Carry a thermose to help wash it down
Now, if there's some left, don't just throw it out
Use it for spackle or bathroom grout, now

Spam in my pantry at home (have some more)
Think of expiration, better read the lable (oh boy)
Now, Spam breakfast, dinner, or lunch (it's the best)
Think about how it's been precooked, wonder if I'll just eat it cold

Now, once you start in, you can't put it down
Don't leave it sitting or it'll turn brown
The key is going to open the tin
The tin is there to keep the spam in

Oh, spam (spam)
Ham and pork
Think about nutrition, wonder what's inside it now (oh boy)
Spam (spam)
It's the best
Really makes a darn good sandwich any way you slice it

Spam in the place where I live (have some more)
Think about addiction, wonder if I'm a junkie now (let's eat)
Spam in the place where I work (you're obsessed)
Think about the way it's processed, wonder if it's some kind of meat

Spam in the back of my car (ham and pork)
Spam any place that you are (ham and pork)
The tab is there to open the can (spam any place that you are) (ham and pork)
The can is there to hold in the spam (spam any place that you are) (ham and pork)

&lt;pre&gt;
Doctor, every night I have the strangest dreams
Doctor, listen to me, tell me what this means
First I'm goin' shoppin' in my underwear
Then all of sudden I'm floating in mid air
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere

Now Doctor, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Next comes the part that I won't ever forget
Now I'm bein' followed by these Russian spies
They give me some velcro, and an order of fries
Suddenly I'm bowling on the Starship Enterprise
I fall down a hole and that's when I realize

I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

All right!

Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain
See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur
Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door
And I'm back in the very same place I was before

Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

And I can't bust out and I can't break free
And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me
And I can't go home and I can't get loose
And I try to escape but it's just no use

And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win
And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in
And I can't go back and I can't get through
But Vanna since you're here, why don't you let me buy a vowel from you

Come on Vanna, come on!

Ow, buhhh

Doctor, all those crazy dreams have started again
That's right, I even wake up screaming now and then
See, I'm coming home from work but I forgot my address
I'm half an hour late for my algebra test
Then some slimy alien jumps out of my chest
And I'm falling and falling and I guess you know the rest

I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Stuck in a closet with Vanna White
N-n-n-night after night after night night night

Then I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White (ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya, ya, ya-ya)
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White (ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya)
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
&lt;/pre&gt;

They showed up on my doorstep just a couple weeks ago
They looked so sweet and harmless
Tell me, how was I to know
They got a little too close to the microwave and then much to my surprise
They grew to forty thousand times their original size
They started mutatin' right before my eyes
Oh my

Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars
A race from a distant place
They came in UFOs shaped just like cuban cigars
Man oh man, you oughta hear 'em squeal
Now the whole wide world is their exercise wheel
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

The president, he's is a panic
The pentagon, they're in shock
There's a team of research scientists
They got 'em workin' 'round the clock
Now the National Guard is out in my back yard
And the Marines'll be comin' around
I hope they get this lousy rodents out of my town
'Cause the property values are goin' way down now

Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars
They're back and they're lookin' for a snack
And they're not that fond of Burger Kings or salad bars
I hope they're not plannin' to stay
Who invited them here anayway
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

Well, well, look at that hamster, he's as big as a blimp
And there's one the size of central park
They're using telephone pole to pick their teeth
They're evil and nasty and they glow in the dark
Oh, don't waste any more of your bullets, boys
You know it just makes 'em mad when you shoot
They're gonna stomp us into jelly and conquer the world
But you gotta admit, they're really kinda cute, now

Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars
What a racquet they're makin', Jack
They keep me up at night playin' they're electric guitars
Listen to 'em squeal
They think the whole stinkin' world is their exercise wheel
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

Hey Jack, you better watch your back
Here come those hamsters from a planet near mars
Well, well, it's called the
Attack of the radioactive hamsters
From a planet

(with radio-like music in the background)

Hi
This is &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic fresh off my Alapalooza World Tour
When I'm not busy signing autographs
Fighting off mobs of beautiful women
Making gold albums
And counting my big pile of money
I listen to the Russ Bowe show on Realradio 104.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Come and listen while I tell
You about a man named Jed
A poor mountaineer
But he kept a family fed

Hey!
Come listen to me now while I tell you a story
About a man named Jed
Tell ya’ll somethin’
He’s a poor mountaineer
But he kept his family fed!

Chord change!
Then one day he was shootin’ at some food
When up near the ground came a bubblin’ crude
Oil that is! Black gold!

Then the next thing you know
Old’ Jed’s a millionaire
Keep away
Chh chh chh
Keep you away from there!

(whispering)

Said California’s the place you outta be
So they loaded up their truck and they moved to Beverly
Hills That Is, come on!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Now, let me tell you 'bout the school cafeteria
It's got all the others beat
It sells over four million burgers a year
Just think, that's almost two pounds of meat

My ice cream sandwich is lukewarm
But my burrito is much too cold
You know a school cafeteria is the only place
That sells artificially colored mold

You know a school cafeteria believes in mass production
They buy those lousy soy beans by the keg
I don't like to complain, but in a school cafeteria
You can buy a taco and get Bubonic Plague

Today in the school cafeteria
They introduced a brand new malt
It's called boysenberry dysentery
Please pass the salt

The tunafish sandwiches'll make you ill
The enchiladas are enough to kill
Before you eat, you'd better make out your will
In the school cafeteria today

After sixty-three years in the business
Our cook still hasn't got The Knack
And all the food in the school cafeteria
Comes from CARE packages that were sent back

Feel your arteries growing hard
As you eat another healthy spoonful of lard

It's no matter that the food is so gross
The health department is afraid to come close
So everybody better hold your nose
In the school cafeteria today

So listen very closely, all you girls and guys
Here's a little message to the wise
You'd better not try the chili surprise
In the school cafeteria today, oh yeah
In the school cafeteria today
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs
In the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from 
Jerry's Bait shop
You know the place
Well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just PEACHY!

Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
My mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast

D'AWWW - BIG BOWL OF SAUERKRAUT!!
EVERY SINGLE MORNIN'!!
It was driving me crazy

I said to my mom
I said &quot;Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?&quot;
And my dear, sweet mother
She just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train,
And she leaned right down next to me
And she said,
*Deep Breath* &quot;IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!!&quot;
And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old

That's when I swore that someday
Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
And the towels are oh so fluffy!
Where the Shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
And anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel

Wacka wacka doodoo yeah!

Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules on Leonard Nimoy's butt
I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
That's right, a first class one-way ticket

To Aaaalbuquerque!
Aaaalbuquerque!

Oh yeah
You know, I've never been on a real airplane before
And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
And the little kid at back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died!
Except for me
You know why?

'Cause I had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position

AH HA HA HA!
Ah ha ha!
Ahhhh...

So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
Where the towels are oh so fluffy!
And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
It's OK, they're clean

Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
And I turned on the Spectravision
And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door

Well now, who could that be?
I say, &quot;Who is it?&quot;
No answer
&quot;Who is it?&quot;
There's no answer
&quot;WHO IS IT?!&quot;
They're not sayin' anything

So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
(Oh man, I hate it when I'm right)
So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
And I'm like &quot;Hey, you can't have that&quot;
&quot;That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me&quot;
And he's like, &quot;Tough&quot;
And I'm like, &quot;Give it&quot;
And he's like, &quot;Make me&quot;
And I'm like, &quot;'Kay&quot;
So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
Yes, indeed, you'd better believe it *Deep Breath*
And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
And you know what it said?
I'll tell you what it said

It said,
&quot;If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again&quot;
&quot;If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator&quot;
&quot;If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again&quot;
&quot;If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator

In Aaaalbuquerque!
Aaaalbuquerque!

Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
But I made a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
I would not sleep for an instant, until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
But first, I decided to buy some donuts

So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
And he says &quot;Yeah, what do ya want?&quot;
[guitar solo]
I said, &quot;You got any glazed donuts?&quot;
He said, &quot;No, we're outta glazed donuts&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, you got any jelly donuts?&quot;
He said, &quot;Nooo, we're outta jelly donuts&quot;
I said, &quot;You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?&quot;
He said, &quot;No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts&quot;
I said, &quot;You got any cinnamon rolls?&quot;
He said, &quot;Nooo! We're outta cinnamon rolls&quot;
I said, &quot;You got any apple fritters?!&quot;
He said, &quot;Nooo! We're outta apple fritters&quot;
I said, &quot;You got any bear claws?!&quot;
He said, &quot;Wait a minute, I'll go check&quot;
[guitar solo]
&quot;NO!! WE'RE OUTTA BEAR CLAWS!&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?&quot;
He says, &quot;All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels&quot;
I said, &quot;OK, I'll take that&quot;

So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
[imitating rabid gnawing sounds]
Oh man, they were just going nuts
They're tearin' me apart
You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head
I believe it went a little something like this . . .

D'AHHH!
GET 'EM OFF ME!
GET 'EM OFF ME!
OHHH!
NO, GET 'EM OFF, GET 'EM OFF
OH, OH GOD, OHHH GOD
OH, GET 'EM OFF ME
OH, OH GOD! I -
AAAAEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!

I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
Like a constipated wiener dog
And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
Her name was Zelda...
She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
She said, 
&quot;Hey, you've got weasels on your face&quot;

That's when I knew it was true love
We were inseparable after that
Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
The world was our burrito
So we got married and we bought us a house
And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah

But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
She said, &quot;Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?&quot;
I said, &quot;Whoa! Hold on now, baby&quot;
&quot;I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment!&quot;
So we broke up and I never saw her again
But that's just the way things go

In Aaaalbuquerque!
Aaaalbuquerque!
[guitar solo]
Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream...
That's right, I got me a part-time job at the Sizzler
I even made employee of the month after I put out that grease fire with my face
Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
I was gettin' a lot of attitude

OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
So I, I say to him, I say &quot;Hey, you want me to help you with that?&quot;
And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
&quot;Noooo, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw&quot;

So I did.

And then he gets all indignant on me
He's like &quot;Hey man, I was just being sarcastic&quot;
Well, that's just great
How was I supposed to know that?
I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy!
So what's he complaining about?

Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
This guy comes up to me on the street and he tells me he hasn't had a bite in three days
Well, I knew what he meant
But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
And I'm like &quot;Hey, come on, don'tcha get it?&quot;
But he just kept rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
&quot;AHH! AHHH!! AHHHH!!!&quot;
You know, completely missing the irony of the whole situation
Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?

Anyway, um... 

Um, where was I?

Kinda lost my train of thought

Um, well, uh, OK
Anyway I, I know it's kind of a roundabout way of saying it
But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is

I 
HATE 
SAUERKRAUT!

That's all I'm really tryin' to say
And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
And find yourself in an existential quandary
Full of loathing and self-doubt
And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
Somewhere out there in this crazy old mixed-up universe of ours
There's still a little place

Called Aaaalbuquerque!
Aaaalbuquerque!
Albuquerque (Albuquerque!)
Albuquerque (Albuquerque!)
Albuquerque (Albuquerque!)
Albuquerque (Albuquerque!)

I said &quot;A&quot; (A!)
&quot;L&quot; (L!)
&quot;B&quot; (B!)
&quot;U&quot; (U!)
...
...
&quot;querque&quot; (querque!!)

(Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque)
(Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque)
(Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque)
(Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque)

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalbuquerque!

[laughing] [drum solo]

*belch*
&lt;/pre&gt;

And you can watch your MTV
And you can watch 'till your eyes fall out of your head
That'll be OK with me

And you can watch (TV)

You can watch Johnny Carson
You can watch Phil Donahue
And you can use TV Guide to help you decide
With capsulized review

Say, you can watch 60 Minutes
Even Captain Kangaroo
But there's only one set, so what ever you watch
Well, you know I gotta watch it too

Say, give it up, give it up, television's taking its toll
That's enough, that's enough, gimme the remote control
I been nice, I been good, please don't do this to me
Turn it off, turn it off, I don't want to have to see

The Brady Bunch
Not The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Yeah, The Brady Bunch

It's the story of a lovely lady
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother
The youngest one in curls

It's a story of a man named Brady
Who was busy with three boys of his own
They were four men living all together
Yeah, but they were all alone

Until the one day, one day when the lady met the fellow
And they knew, and they knew it was much more than a hunch
Then they knew this group must somehow form a family
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way they all became

The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Yeah, The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Oh, it's The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch
Oh, The Brady Bunch, yeah
Oh, The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
They tell us that we lost our tails
Evolving up from little snails
I say it's all just wind and sails
Are we not men, we are Devo
Are we not men, D E V O

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

(I'm A Man) I'm a boy
(I'm A Man) Well, I'm your mother
(I'm A Man) I'm a one night stand
(I'm A Man) Am I bi
(I'm A Man) I'm your slave
(I'm A Man) I'm a little girl when we make love together

Hey, hey, hey
Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better, better, better, better, better, better, yeah

L.A. woman, you're my woman
Got my mojo risin', Mr. Mojo risin', hey

In-a-gada-da-vida, honey Don't you know that I love you 
In-a-gada-da-vida, baby Don't you know that I'll always be true

Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand
Gonna shoot my old lady
Caught her messin' 'round with another man

Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo. Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo. Yoddle-ay he-hoo.
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo. Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo. Yoddle-ay he-hoo.

I'm an ordinary guy burnin' down the house

I'm hot blooded, check it and see
Got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on, baby, do you do more than dance
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watchin' you

Darling, you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'till the end of time
But you gotta let me know, woh, woh, woh
Should I stay or should I go

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas, gas, gas

People try to put us down (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things we do look awful c-c-cold (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Hope I die before I get old (talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation, baby (talkin' 'bout my generation)
(talkin' 'bout my generation)
My, my, my, my, my, my generation (my generation)
Well, talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-generation

&lt;pre&gt;
There's a sale on our gabardine suits today
They're all thirty percent off from yesterday
There's Fortrel polyester, leather, wool, and tweed
Just a Visa or MasterCard is all you need
We've got every color, we've got every shade
We're located next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
We got every fabric that was ever made
But I'm known in this city as the King of Suede

We got portly and regular and extra long
Is my size up there
We got tailors to fix it if it comes out wrong
Is my size up there

We got all kinds of sweatshirts, you can take your pick
Is my size up there
With the collars ripped off like that Flashdance flick
Is my size up there

Our prices are low, my staff is underpaid
You can buy off the rack or have it custom made
And it's all guaranteed to never shrink or fade
'Cause of my reputation as the King of Suede

If you need a tuxedo for your junior prom
Is my size up there
We can get you the best one that's made in Taiwan
Is my size up there

We got jackets with patches on the elbows too
Is my size up there
And we'll sell 'em all factory direct to you
Is my size up there

Well, I never made it past the second grade
It took all of my life for me to learn this trade
But my friends are all thinking that I've got it made
'Cause I'm known the world over as the King of Suede

There's a two for one sale on our three piece suits
Check out our suede pajamas and our suede covered boots
You can try on our suede underwear if you choose
Do what you want but don't step on my blue suede shoes

King of Suede

Don't miss out on our giant liquidation sale
Is my size up there
Look for our color catalog in next week's mail
Is my size up there

There's a sale on our double knit slacks today
It's the same old sale as yesterday

Thirty years in the same location I have stayed
There I am, right next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
I got tough competition but I'm not afraid
'Cause it's my destiny to be the King of Suede

King of Suede
King of Suede
King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
What's the matter with the songs he's singin'
Can't you tell that they're pretty lame
After listenin' to a couple albums
Well, they all start to sound the same

So he tried to change his musical style
He tossed all his ballads in the circular file
Then he found the punk sound
Breakin' ground all around
It's still Billy Joel to me

What's the matter with the tune he's writin'
Well, you know it's gonna be a smash
It's so nice when you're a big name artist
Doesn't matter if it sounds like trash

Now everybody thinks the new wave is super
Just ask Linda Ronstadt or even Alice Cooper
It's a big hit, isn't it
Even if it's a piece of junk
It's still Billy Joel to me

Woah, it doesn't matter what the critics say about him
'Cause he doesn't worry how they feel
When you're record's sellin' millions and it's goin' triple platinum
You don't worry 'bout your next meal
'Cause money is no big deal

Maybe he should dye his hair bright pink
And stick a safety pin through his cheeks
Then he'd really fit the new wave image
But he couldn't sit down for weeks

Don't you know about the record business, honey
You gotta be trendy if you wanna make some money
Now everybody's sayin' that he sure sounds funny
But it's still Billy Joel to me

All right, Alfred
Oh

I can hardly wait 'til his next album
Well, I'll bet it's gonna be the rage
Buy a ticket to his next big concert
Well, I wonder what he'll do on stage

It might be disco and it might be the blues
Or maybe even somethin' like the B-52's
Just a handclap, finger snap
Even if it's mindless pap
It's still Billy Joel to me

Everybody's sayin' that he sure sounds funny
But it's still Billy Joel to me
&lt;/pre&gt;

I eat filet mignon seven times a day
My bathtub's filled with Perrier
What can I say?
This is the life

I buy a dozen cars when I'm in the mood
I hire somebody to chew my food
I'm an upwardly mobile dude
This is the life

They say that money corrupts you
But I can't really tell
I got the whole world at my feet
And I think it's pretty swell

I got women lined up outside my door
They've been waitin' there since the week before
Who could ask for more
This is the life

(What up? What up?)
You're dead for a real long time
You just can't prevent it
So if money can't buy happiness
I guess I'll have to rent it

Yeah, every day I make the front page news
No time to pay my dues
I got a million pairs of shoes
This is the life

(Bop-badayabop-bop-bop-bop)
(Badada-da-dabaadayaba!)
(Ooohwhaaa-whaawhaa-aaah) Adibadabidada-ba-ooh
Da-bop-bop-bow!

(Buhbuhbuhbuh)

(Whaa-whaa-whaa-ooh...)
I got a solid gold Cadillac
I make a fortune while I sleep
You can tell I'm a living legend
Not some ordinary creep

No way, I'm the boss, the big cheese
Yeah, I got this town on its knobby little knees
And I can do just what I please
This is the life

That's right, I'm the king, number one
I buy monographed Kleenex by the ton
I pay the bills, I call the shots
I grease the palms, I buy the yachts

One thing I can guarantee
The best things in life, they sure ain't free
It's such a thrill just to be me
This is the life
(Waaah) This is the life
&lt;/pre&gt;

* This is one of the many [[&quot;Weird Al&quot;]] songs where the theme is [[Television]].
* This song is about {{W|Cable}}.
* At one point it says &quot;I got a satellite dish on the trunk of my car&quot; which is ironic seeing as the song is called &quot;Cable TV.&quot;
* In the last verse of the song it says &quot;'Cause I've seen 'Porky's' [[27]] times this week.&quot;

I used to think my life was so empty
I used to think life was passin' me by
Well, I was just about ready
To curl up and die

But then one day I got a visit
From the cable company
Well, they hooked me up and plugged me right in
And now I got cable TV

And now I get to watch the stock report in Korean
Midget wrestling on channel three
It costs me fifty bucks a month just to see 'em
Yeah, but that's all right with me

I got cable TV (Cable TV)
Cable TV (Cable TV)
Oh, eighty-three channels of ecstasy
I love my cable TV, yeah
I love my cable TV

I got the Siamese Faith Healer's Network
The news and weather from Peru
I got celebrity hockey
The Racketball Channel too

Bugs Bunny direct from Atlanta
Mr. Wizard is on at five
I got a satellite dish on the trunk of my car
So I can watch MTV while I drive

I'm talkin' 'bout real quality programs
The kind you just can't get for free
Now I never wanna leave my apartment
'Cause there's just so much for me to see

On my cable TV (Cable TV)
Cable TV(Cable TV)
Well, if you need to find me
You know where I'll be
Watchin' my cable TV, yeah
Watchin' my cable TV

'Cause I love my cable TV, yeah
I love my cable TV

My friends are gettin' kinda worried
They think I'm turning into some kinda freak
Oh, but they're just jealous 'cause I've seen Porky's
Twenty-seven times this week

On my cable TV (Cable TV)
Cable TV (Cable TV)
Yeah, the greatest thing that's ever happened to me
I love my cable TV, yeah
I love my cable TV

Well, I got to have cable TV, yeah
I need my cable TV

Well, I love, I love my cable TV (TV)
Got to have cable TV (TV)
Well, I got to have my cable TV, yeah (TV)
Can't live without my cable TV (TV)

Well, I said, got to have some cable TV (TV)
I've got to have my cable TV
I said cable TV, yeah (TV)
Got to have cable TV
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Things just haven't been the same
Since the flying saucer came
Now the aliens are on the loose

Well, we tried to hold 'em back
Tried to ward off their attack
But our atom bombs were just no use

They were ugly, they were mean
Biggest heads I ever seen
They made everybody scream and shout

First they leveled Tokyo
Then New York was next to go
Boy I really wish they'd cut it out

They wasted everybody on my block
There goes the neighborhood
They'll zap you with their death ray eyes
And blow you up real good

Run for your lives
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
They're not very nice to the human race
(Slime creatures from outer space)

There's more comin' every day
And they just won't go away
Now they're reproducing in the sewers

They got slimy lizard skin
And an evil lookin' grin
And they sure could use some manicures

They got hands all covered with fungus
They got eyes like some kinda bug
I sure hope they don't come in here
I just shampooed the rug

Run for your lives
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

They're really makin' a mess of this place.
(Slime creatures)
(Slime creatures)

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

They'll rip your head off just for fun
They'll paralyze your mind
They're wearin' out their welcome

I don't think I like their kind
They'll suck your brain out through a straw
You just can't trust those guys

So hide the children, lock the doors
And always watch the skies
Look out, here come the

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
They're an intergalactic disgrace

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
I wish they'd just get outta my face
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

They're makin' a big fat mess of this place
(Slime creatures)
(Slime creatures)

Oh, where did they come from?
What do they want from us?
Who do they think they are?
(Slime creatures, slime creatures)

Why don't they leave me alone?
(Slime creatures, slime creatures.)
They're really getting on my nerves
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Aahh

Well I heard that you're leavin' (leavin')
Gonna leave me far behind (so far behind)
'Cause you found a brand new lover
You decided that I'm not your kind (aahh..)

So I pulled (I pulled) your name out (name out) of my Rolodex (oohh..)
And I tore all your pictures in two
And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go
Just because it reminds me of you (dippity dippity doo)

That's right (that's right) you ain't gonna see me cryin'
I'm glad (I'm glad) that you found somebody new
'Cause I'd rather spend eternity eating shards of broken glass
Than spend one more minute with you

I guess I might seem kinda bitter
You got me feeling down in the dumps
'Cause I'm stranded all alone in the gas station of love
And I have to use the self-service pumps

Oh, so honey, let me help you with that suitcase
You ain't (you ain't) gonna break my heart in two
'Cause I'd rather get a hundred thousand paper cuts on my face
Than spend one more minute with you

I'd rather rip out my intestines with a fork
Than watch you going out with other men
I'd rather slam my fingers in a door (yeah)
Again and again and again and again and again

Oh, can't you see what I'm tryin' to say, Darling...

I'd rather have my blood sucked out by leeches (leeches)
Shove an icepick under a toenail or two
I'd rather clean all the bathroom in Grand Central Station with my tongue
Than spend one more minute with you

Yes, I'd rather jump naked on a huge pile of thumbtacks
Or stick my nostrils together with crazy glue
I'd rather dive into a swimming pool filled with double-edged razor blades
Than spend one more minute with you

I'd rather rip my heart out of my ribcage with my bare hands
and then throw it on the floor and stomp on it 'till I die
Than spend one more minute with you
&lt;/pre&gt;

George, George, George of the jungle
Strong as he can be
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree

George, George, George of the jungle
Lives a life that's free
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree

When he gets in scrapes
When he makes his escapes
With the help of his friend
An ape named Ape

Then away he'll schlep
On his elephant Shep
While Fella and Ursula
Stay in step with

George, George, George of the jungle
Friend to you and me
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree
Watch out for that (Ahhh) (Oooh) tree
George, George, George of the Jungle
Friend to you and me

==Trivia==
* Madonna, who created the original, “Like a Virgin” actually asked “Weird Al” to do a parody of her song. That was the first time that a songwriter asked “Weird Al” to do a parody of their song.
* This song has no relation to the song by {{W|Ciara}}.

===Music Video===
[[Image:Likeasurgeon.PNG|thumb|200px]]
* The music video for this song was shot in an actual hospital that went out of business.
*In the beginning of the video, a voice pages &quot;Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard&quot;. This is a nod to the {{W|Three Stooges}}' short ''[[Wikipedia:Men in Black (1934 film)|Men in Black]]'' (which incidentally took place in a hospital and featured incompetent doctors).
*As the music begins, there is a person on a bed that is being pushed along who has feet at both ends of the body.
*A male lion walks across the hallway of the hospital, a reference to the music video for [[Wikipedia:Like A Virgin|Like A Virgin]], the song which this is parodying.
*In the operating room, the game ''[[Wikipedia:Operation (game)|Operation]]'' can be seen hanging on the wall.
*The table of operating tools includes a hand drill, crayons, a rubber frog, drinking straws, a thin razored saw, salt and pepper, a blacksmith tool, a troll doll, kitchen knives, a corkscrew, and various others.
*The lobotomized patient is reading the ''Midnight Star'', the titular tabloid from Yankovic's earlier song &quot;[[Midnight Star]].&quot;
*A football player can be seen in the &quot;nurse huddle&quot; near the middle of the video.
*A [[Wikipedia:Madonna|Madonna]] lookalike is seen as a nurse in the video (see the single artwork).
*Yankovic dances like Madonna near the end of the video, parodying scenes from her video of &quot;[[Wikipedia:Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]&quot; (with the camera at one point focusing on his bellybutton as it does Madonna's) as well as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.
*One of the monitors features a clip from ''[[George Of The Jungle]]''. The theme song for this show was covered by Yankovic on the ''[[Album:Dare To Be Stupid|Dare to be Stupid]]'' album, which also included &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;.
*One of his patients has a sign that reads &quot;[[27]]&quot;, and in the background a sign reads &quot;Now Serving: 27&quot;. This, along with a 27 that appeared in &quot;[[This Is The Life]]&quot; is considered to be the beginning of Yankovic's recurring 27 joke.
*The toy accordian that was removed from the patient, which is [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]'s favorite instrument
*Near the end of the song, Yankovic can be seen dancing on a bed. This is a parody of the Like a Virgin video where Madonna rides canals through Venice.

Lyrics:

I finally made it through med school
Somehow I made it through
I'm just an intern
I still make a mistake or two

I was last in my class
Barely passsed at the institute
Now I'm trying to avoid, yah I'm trying to avoid
A malpractise suit

Hey, like a surgeon
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Organ transplants are my line

Better give me all your gause nurse
This patient's fading fast
Complications have set in
Don't know how long he'll last

Let me see, that I.V.
Here we go - time to operate
I'll pull his indsides out, pull his insides out
And see what he ate

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Here's a waiver for you to sign

Woe, woe, woe

It's a fact - I'm a quack
The disgrace of the A.M.A.
'Cause my patients die, yah my patients die
Before they can pay

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind

Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and retractors
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh

Ooh baby, yah
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I finally made it through med school
Somehow I made it through
I'm just an intern
I still make a mistake or two

I was last in my class
Barely passsed at the institute
Now I'm trying to avoid, yah I'm trying to avoid
A malpractise suit

Hey, like a surgeon
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Organ transplants are my line

Better give me all your gause nurse
This patient's fading fast
Complications have set in
Don't know how long he'll last

Let me see, that I.V.
Here we go - time to operate
I'll pull his indsides out, pull his insides out
And see what he ate

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Here's a waiver for you to sign

Woe, woe, woe

It's a fact - I'm a quack
The disgrace of the A.M.A.
'Cause my patients die, yah my patients die
Before they can pay

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind

Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and retractors
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh

Ooh baby, yah
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Woah-oh!

I want a new duck
One that won't try to bite
One that won't chew a hole in my socks
One that won't quack all night

I want a new duck
One with big webbed feet
One that knows how to wash my car
And keep his room real neat

One that won't raid the ice box
One that'll stay in shape
One that's never gonna try to migrate or escape
Or I'll tie him up with duck tape

I want a new duck
A mallard I think
One that won't make a mess of my house
Or build a nest in the bathroom sink

I want a new duck
One that won't steal my beer
One that won't stick his bill in my mail
One that knows the duck stops here

One that won't drive me crazy waddling all around
One who'll teach me how to swim and help me not to drown
And show me how to get down
How to get down baby

Get it?
(Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack)
(Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack) (Quack-quack-quack,  quack-quack, qua-quack)
(Quack-quack, qua-quack)
(Quack-quack-quack, quack, quack, quack)

I want a new duck
Not a swan or a goose
Just a drake I can dress real cute
Think I'm gonna name him Bruce

I want a new duck
Not a quail or an owl
One that won't molt to much
One that won't smell too fowl

One that won't beg for breadcrumbs
Hangin' around all day
He'd better mind his manners
Better do just what I say
Or he's gonna be duck patte, duck patte, yeah, yeah
(Quaaaaack!)

(Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack)
(Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack) (Quack-quack-quack,  quack-quack, qua-quack)
(Quack-quack, qua-quack)
(Quack-quack-quack, qua-quack-quack-quaaack)
[lots of quacking sounds]

&lt;pre&gt;
Some girls like to buy new shoes
And others like drivin' trucks and wearing tattoos
There's only one thing that they all like a bunch
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

I know how to keep a woman satisfied
When I whip out my Diner's Card their eyes get so wide
They're always in the mood for something to munch
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some lunch
Don't ask 'em to dinner or breakfast or brunch
'Cause girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

Girls, they want
Want to have lunch
Girls wanna have

She eats like she got a hole in her neck
And I'm the one that always gets stuck with the check
Can't figure out how come they don't weigh a ton
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some lunch
Don't know for certain but I've got a hunch
Those girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

Girls, they want
Want to have lunch
Girls wanna have

They just wanna
They just wanna
Girls

They just wanna
They just wanna
Girls just wanna have lunch

Girls
Girls just wanna have lunch

They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lyrics:

You're takin' to me good
Just like you know you should
You get me on my knees
Please, baby, please

She looks so great, every time I see her face
She put me in a state (ooh, state of shock)

Top coat, top hat
I don't worry, 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love
They come a runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man, hey

Woo, ah ha

Oh, what's love, got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart, when a heart can be broken

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than the owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Yow

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it any more

Neun und neunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man fuer UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General

Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off my Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

So why don't you use it
Try not to bruise it
Find time, don't lose it

Bang your head
Metal health'll drive ya mad
Bang your head
Metal health'll drive ya mad

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to sock it to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
When you want to come
When you want to come
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I know that you don't know me very well
We've barely met, but I can surely tell
No one will ever love you like I do

I like to feel the warm spot on your chair
Sometimes I drool and usually I stare
My precious one
I saved that gum that you threw in the garbage

You're the one I dream about
But the only question with me now is
Do I creep you out?

Every time I shake your hand now
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth
Do I creep you out?

Call you every night and hang up
Gonna carve your name in my leg
In my leg

Something I should ask about
Can I sniff the pit stains on your blouse?
And do I creep you
Do I creep you out?

Your restraining order's out
Still the only question with me now (oh, the only question)
Is do I creep you out? (is do I creep you out?)

Know exactly where you live now
Followed you from work back to your house
(Followed you from work back to your house)
Well, do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?

Fatter, fatter
Shake 'n Bake, fatter
Shake 'n Bake, fatter
Fatter

Corndogs, pizza, Coca Cola
Yogurt, butterscotch, granola
Look at me, I'm fatter
I'm fatter, I'm fatter

Friends all gather 'round me
My enemies surround me
Yelling &quot;Fatso, fatso, fatso&quot;
I've eaten at every single greasy spoon on Seventh Avenue
That's right, I'm fatter

Don't you know my weight is going up, up, up, up, up
I tell you, this turkey sure is tough
Tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough

They got pizza on the west side
French fries up town
Corn dogs deep fried in batter
I'm fatter

Go ahead, bite the big apple
Don't mind the calories
Pile it on my platter
I'm fatter

Pile it up, pile it high up
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Found a job in a great big office
And I really love this place
I got my, my very own Scotch tape dispenser
And I got a private parking space, ha

And I, I got a coffee mug with my name right on it
In big bold letters so everyone knows it's mine
Don't even touch it, 'cause, 'cause it doesn't belong to you
I'm watching you, so don't get funny

I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder
Watch out, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog, here we go

I love to watch my boss get angry
So I can count the veins in his neck, ha
Every day is like a picnic
Every Friday, get a check

Well, do I smell jelly donuts? This is my lucky day
I'll have some coffee with a carcinogenic sweetener
Hold on a minute, just one more jelly donut
They'll never miss it, no, they'll never miss it

I, I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right
Watch out, hey, well, it's dog eat dog

Sometimes I can't believe this is all really happening
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm really sitting here
Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler
Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful chair

No-duddi-o d-du-du-oh-ya, ha, ha

Nobody's sure what I do here
And, ah, that's just fine with me
Five o'clock is here much too soon now
'Cause I just never wanna leave

I can bend paper clips into the shapes of small animals
Maybe I could get on, on David Letterman
I think I made a big mistake
Where's my liquid paper, where's my liquid paper

I, I'm climbing up, way up the corporate ladder now
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right
Better be careful now, it's dog eat dog
Watch me work, hey, hey, stand back now
Look out, mama, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels real good

Hey, dog eat dog, here we go (doggy doggy dog dog, it's dog eat dog)
I said pang-ang, dog eat dog (woof woof, hey hey, dog eat dog)
I said, (sound), dog eat dog (here we go, ha, dog eat dog)
La la ha he, dog eat dog, la la ha he, dog eat dog (ruff ruff, dog eat dog, dog eat dog)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Got to work late 'cause my alarm was busted
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted
'Cause it's one of those days, it's just one of those days

I lost one of my socks in the drier
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire
Just one of those days, it's just one of those days

I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree
A big swarm of locusts is following me
There's not even anything good on TV
It's just one of those day, it's just one of those days

Left all my Beatles records out in the sun
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue
It's just one of those days, gonna be one of those days

The nazis tied me up and covered me with ants
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants
Just one of those days, ever have one of those days

The bank called me up and told me I'm overdrawn
Some freaks are burnin' crosses out on my front lawn
And I can't believe it, all the Cheetos are gone
It's just, just one of those, one of those days
Just one of those, one of those days

The F.B.I. has got a tap on my phone
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone
Shouldn't have got up this morning, should've known
It's just one of those days, it's just one of those days

A 747 crashed into my den
And there's nothin' but tater-tots for dinner again
It's just one of those days
Never mind, it's just one of those days

Big steamroller just ran over my mom
And I cut myself shaving and they're dropping the bomb
It's just one of those days
That's all, it's just one of those days

Then late at night, just before I go to bed
The world blows up and now everybody's dead
You just can't deny it, it's just like I said
Just, just one of those, one of those days
Just one of those, one of those days

It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days (just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I don't care if you wreck my car or shave off all my hair
You can go and run your vacuum during my favorite show
And I'll let you call up folks in Europe you don't even know
Anything you want, babe, if it makes you happy

But I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can spend my money, you can waste my time
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes
Don't wear those shoes

It's all right, you can play your Twisted Sister every night
I suppose you can lick the middles out of my Oreos
Or start laughing when you're drinking milk so it comes out your nose
And you know that I'd do anything to please you

But I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can spit in my face if you're so inclined
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes

(Oh no, oh no)
Oh no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't wear those (shoes)

Use my razor to shave your legs or eat crackers in bed
Stomp the poodle till it's flat
You could even shove a six inch railroad spike through my head
I could learn to live with that

But now I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can whip me, beat me, rob me blind
Baby I don't mind, but please don't wear those

I said oh no, oh no, oh no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh no, oh no, oh no, don't wear those shoes

You can scratch up my records, you can drink my booze
But baby, please don't wear those shoes
You can make me an offer I can't refuse
But darling, please don't wear those shoes

You can play your bongos while I'm trying to snooze
But honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can expose yourself on the six o'clock news
But please, please don't wear those shoes

I said oh no, oh no, oh no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh no, oh no, oh no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh no, oh no, oh no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh no, oh no, oh no

&lt;pre&gt;
It's Christmas at Ground Zero
There's music in the air
The sleigh bells are ringin' and the carolers are singin'
While the air raid sirens blare

It's Christmas at Ground Zero
The button has been pressed
The radio just let us know
That this is not a test

Everywhere the atom bombs are droppin'
It's the end of all humanity
No more time for last minute shoppin'
It's time to face your final destiny

Well, it's Christmas at Ground Zero
There's panic in the crowd
We can dodge debris while we trim the tree
Underneath a mushroom cloud

(siren)

You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
But if someone's climbin' down your chimney
You better load your gun and shoot to kill

Oh, it's Christmas at Ground Zero
And if the radiation level's okay
I'll go out with you and see the all new
Mutations on New Year's Day

It's Christmas at Ground Zero
Just seconds left to go
I'll duck and cover with my yuletide lover
Underneath the mistletoe

It's Christmas at Ground Zero
Now the missiles are on their way
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked
On this jolly holiday
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked
On this jolly holiday

(siren)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Potato skins, potato cakes
Hash browns, and instant flakes
Baked or boiled or french fried
There's no kind you haven't tried

You planned a trip to Idaho
Just to watch potatoes grow
I understand how you must feel
I can't deny they've got appeal

Whoah
You like them whether they are plain or they're stuffed, oh yeah
Better face the facts, it seems you can't get enough
You know, you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to spuds

Your greasy hands, your salty lips
Looks like you found the chips
Your belly aches, your teeth grind
Some tator tots would blow your mind

And you don't mind if they're not cooked
You need your fix, I guess you're hooked
And late at night you always dream
Of bacon bits and sour cream

Whoah, you like them even if they're lumpy or tough, oh yeah
Whee, It's pretty obvoius to me you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to spuds

Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds

Ooh yeah

I'm givin' up, it'sjust no use
Another case of spud abuse
What can I say, what can I do
Potato bug has got me too, Wahoo

I used to hate them, now they're all that I eat, oh yeah
Whee, I've often seen then whipped, but they just can't be beat
Now I'm gonna have to face it
I'm addicted to spuds

Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds

Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds

Help me out! Dig!

Wooh!
All I do is... grunt and groan
Hurts me to walk, anywhere
Went to see my physician, Dr. Jones
He took my trousers off, told me to cough
(Doctor says there ain't nothin') To discuss
He tells me any day, I might have to wear a truss, wooh!

(Living with a hernia...) Ow!
All the time, such aggravation
(Living with a hernia...)
Gonna be... my ruination
(Living with a hernia...)
Got to have an operation
Feel so old, heh... ow! ... Huh!

Too much... back pain
Good gawd, drive me insane
Can't run, barely crawl
Got a bulge in my, intestinal wall
Walk real funny, bless my soul
Can't play tennis, and it's hard to bowl, wooh!
(You can't even do the splits now...) Say it!
(Better call it quits now)
Now I'm sick of all this dancin'... and anyhow!

(Living with a hernia...) Crack!
Hurts me bad... in a tender location
(Living with a hernia...)
Had enough... humiliation
(Living with a hernia...) Yeaaah!
Got to have an operation, ow!

I (Live with a hernia)
Can't get up, can't bend over
Now I (Live with a hernia)

Wait a minute...

You may not be familiar with the common types

So just settle down, let me clue you in
There's Incomplete (Incomplete!)

There he goes, he drives me crazy
When he says &quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
That's his job, it's so amazing
All he says is &quot;Here's Johnny&quot;

I never miss a moment when he's on the tube
His being there has made my life worth living
The chills run down my spine
Each time he says that line

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; He says, and laughs in his special way
&quot;Johnny&quot; he says, you know I love him
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says and second fiddle is his game
Ed McMahon's his name, all right
Woah, oh yeah

Dressed so fine, he's such a cool dude
Hear him say &quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
Watch him selling beer and dog food
Hear him say &quot;Here's Johnny&quot;

I got a letter from him just the other day
He said &quot;You may already be a winner&quot;
A trooper to the end
A Clydesdale's best friend

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says and laughs in his special way
&quot;Johnny&quot; he says, you know I love him
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says and that's the way he gets his pay
What a living

Oh &quot;Here's Johnny, Here's Johnny&quot; Woah no
&quot;Here's Johnny, Here's Johnny&quot; No no, no no no no I don't believe it
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says and every time it's just the same
Ed McMahon's his name

(Special guy) A very special guy, all right
(He's on) He's on every night
(Every night) Can't change the channel
When he's sitting on the panel

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
There he goes, he gives me goose bumps
When he says &quot;Hey-Oh, Hey-Hey-Oh&quot;

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says and laughs in his special way
&quot;Johnny&quot; he says, you know I love him
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; he says, that seems to be his claim to fame
Ed McMahon's his name

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; (laughing)

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; (laughing)
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; (laughing)

&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; (laughing)
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot; (laughing)

&quot;Here's&quot;
&quot;Here's Johnny&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
They only show you their gums when they smile
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now, how vile
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss

Hey, stand up
Toothless people, their breath is lethal, wanna tell you
Hey, come on, stand up, get on your feet
Toothless people, old and feeble, what I say

No more of those pearly whites will they possess
Their oral hygiene is frightful, a mess
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities

Hey, stand up, take out your teeth
Toothless people, old and feeble, oh yes

You can brush 'em, you can floss 'em
They're something you just can't ignore
If you lose 'em, you're in trouble
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more
You need something to show your dentist
The next time he makes you say &quot;Ah&quot;
You don't wanna have to wind up
Eating all of your food through a straw

(Like toothless people, toothless people)
You'd better brush your teeth now (hey)
Toothless, toothless, toothless, toothless people
Hey, stand up, toothless people
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down all around the bends
You can have a bumper car bumping
This amusement never ends

I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Ah, oh let me be your sledgehammer
This can be your testimony, yeah

Yeah

There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-sussudio
Oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-sussudio, whoa oh

And my girl wants to
Party all the time, party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time
She parties all the time

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally
We're going riding on the freeway of love (wind's against our back)
We're going riding on the freeway of love (in a pink Cadillac)

That's why you need
That's why
That's what you need
That's what you need

Ya ya ya, do the Harlem polka
(Everybody now)
Ya ya ya, do the Harlem polka

She's got it, yeah baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
What's your desire

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

I like this part

Ooh, rock me Amadeus
Ooh, rock me Amadeus
Ooh, rock me Amadeus
Ooh

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can't do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on

Please, papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I've made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
I'm gonna keep my baby
I'm gonna keep my baby

Oh, I couldn't live a single day without you
Actually, on second thought, well, I suppose I could
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, honey, you're the greatest
Well, at any rate, I guess you're pretty good

Now, it seems to me I'm relatively lucky
I know I probably couldn't ask for too much more
I honestly can say you're an above average lady
You're almost just what I've been looking for

You're sort of everything I ever wanted
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow
You're the woman that I've always dreamed of
Well, not really, but you're good enough for now

You're pretty close to what I've always hoped for
That's why my love for you is fairly strong
And I swear I'm never gonna leave you, darlin'
At least 'til something better comes along

'Cause you're sort of everything I ever wanted
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow
You're the woman that I've always dreamed of
Well, not really, but you're good enough for now
No, not really, but you're good enough for now

==Song Connections==
While the song is considered a style parody rather than an actual parody, the chorus is quite similar to that of {{W|Marshall Crenshaw}}'s &quot;{{W|You're My Favorite Waste of Time}}.&quot;

==Trivia==
* Al actually rented an apartment in the &quot;Gailmore Building&quot; mentioned in the song &quot;Melanie&quot;. The Gailmore Apartments are located at 108 S. Gramercy Place in Los Angeles, CA.

Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

She lived across the street on the fifteenth floor of the Gilmore building
I saw her in the shower reaching for some soap
I knew she had to be the girl for me
And to think I probably never would have found her
If I hadn't bought that telescope

Oh, Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

I just can't understand it
Why won't you return my phone calls
Are you still mad I gave a Mohawk to your cat
If you'd just say the word
I'm certain that our love would last forever and ever
Or are you too dumb to realize that

Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me
How can you ignore me when you know that I can't live without you
I have to go through your garbage just to learn more about you

Melanie, ooh
Oh sweet Me-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

You weren't impressed when I tattooed your name across my forehead
You wouldn't listen when I promised to be true
I couldn't stand it so I jumped out from the sixteenth story window
Right above you
Now I may be dead but I still love you

Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

I'm singin' Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet, sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

I'm singin' Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

I'm singin' Me-he-he-helanie
What can the problem be
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie
Why won't you go out with me

&lt;pre&gt;
Oh some times I think back to when I was younger
Life was so much simpler then
Dad would be up at dawn
He'd be watering the lawn
Or maybe going fishing again

Oh and mom would be fixing up something in the kitchen
Fresh biscuits or hot apple pie
And I'd spend all day long in the basement
Torturing rats with a hack-saw
And pulling the wings off of flies

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days

I can still remember good old Mr. Fender
Who ran the corner grocery store
Oh, he'd strolled down the aisle with a big friendly smile
And he'd say &quot;Howdy&quot; when you walked in the door

Always treated me nice, gave me kindly advice
I don't know why I set fire to his place
Oh I'll never forget the day I bashed in his head
Well you should've seen the look on his face

Let me tell ya now

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days

Do you remember sweet Michelle
She was my high school romance
She was fun to talk to and nice to smell
So I took her to the homecoming dance

Then I tied her to a chair and I shaved off all her hair
And I left her in the desert all alone
Well sometimes in my dreams
I can still hear the screams
Oh I wonder if she ever made it home

I tell ya

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days

Let me tell ya buddy

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's really something kinda strange about you, baby, but I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

You make me wanna hide a weasel in my shorts
You make me wanna phone home
You make me wanna write a dozen book reports
Then pack myself in Styrofoam
Sometimes you make me want to build a model of the Eiffel Tower out of Belgian waffles

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what, what you do to me

You make me wanna hang out in a trailer park
Then take my hamster to the beach
You make me wanna do my laundry in the dark
And use a recommended bleach
When I'm with you I don't know whether I should study neurosurgery or go to see the Care Bears movie

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what, what you do to me

That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
You make me wanna break the laws of time and space
You make me wanna eat pork
You make me wanna staple bagels to my face
Then remove 'em with a pitchfork
You know there's something quite unusual about you but I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what, what you do to me

(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do-do-do-do-do to me

(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do
(You make me) That's what you do to me
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
When we first met she seemed perfectly normal...
I never dreamed she'd make my life so hard
You see, my baby, she started to change...
Started lookin' kinda strange
Wearin' all that white makeup and those black leotards
Well, I guess she kept her little secret pretty well
Now, ever since I learned the horrible truth, you know my life has been a livin' hell!
That's right, you see...

She never told me she was a mime!
She never told me she was a mime, oh no!
Actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the time
She never told me, she never told me she was a...
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mime!

I wish we both could just talk it all over...
But my baby won't even make a sound
And now she makes everybody sick
Doin' that pantomime shtick
Even our old friends have stopped comin' around
Well, my parents can't stand her and our neighbors hate her guts
She's really, really embarrassing me; this silent treatment's driving me nuts!
You see...

She never told me she was a mime!
She never told me she was a mime, oh no!
Now she's actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the time... what a crime
She never told me (she never told me) she never told me she was a... miiiiiime!

She walks against the wind in everywhere we go...
Stops at every corner, gotta put on a show...
Carries 'round a picture of Marcel Marceau...
Always was the quiet type, but how was I to know?!

She never told me she was a mime!
She never told me she was a mime, oh no!
Actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the ti-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yime
She never told me, she never told me she was a mime!

She never told me, she never told me
She never, she never told me she was a mime
She never told me, she never told me
She never, she never told me she was a mime
She never told me (she never told me), she never told me (she never told me)
She never, she never told me she was a mime
She never told me (she never told me), she never told me (she never told me)
She never, she never told me she was a mime!

She was a mime, she was a mime
She was a...
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mime!

&lt;pre&gt;
Oh, this is a story 'bout a guy named Al
And he lived in a sewer with his hamster pal
But the sanitation workers really didn't approve
So he packed up his accordion and had to move
To a city in Ohio where he lived in a tree
And he worked in a nasal decongestant factory
And he played on the company bowling team
And every single night he had a strange recurring dream
Where he was wearing lederhosen in a vat of sour cream
But that's really not important to the story

Well, the very next year he met a dental hygienist
With a spatula tattooed on her arm (on her arm)
But he didn't keep in touch
And he lost her number
Then he got himself a job on a tator-tot farm
And he spent his life-savings on a split-level cave
Twenty miles below the surface of the Earth (of the Earth)
And he really makes a might fine jelly bean and pickle sandwich
For what it's worth

Then one day Al was in the forest trying to get a tan
When he heard the tortured screaming of a funny little man
He was caught in a bear trap and Al set him free
And the guy that he rescued was grateful as could be
And it turns out he's a big-shot producer on TV
So he gives Al a contract and what do ya know
Now he's got his very own Weird Al show

(much unintelligible talking and yelling)
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1880">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge
To break international copyright law
By downloading MP3s from file-sharing sites
Like Morpheus or Grokster or Limewire or Kazaa

But deep in your heart you know the guilt would drive you mad
And the shame would leave a permanent scar
'Cause you start out stealing songs and then you're robbing liquor stores
And sellin' crack and runnin' over school kids with your car

So don't download this song
The record store's where you belong
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh, don't download this song

Oh, you don't wanna mess with the R-I-double-A
They'll sue you if you burn that CD-R
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma or a seven year old girl
They'll treat you like the evil hard-bitten criminal scum you are

So don't download this song
Don't go pirating music all day long
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh, don't download this song

Don't take away money from artists just like me
How else can I afford another solid gold Hum-Vee
And diamond-studded swimming pools
These things don't grow on trees
So all I ask is, &quot;Everybody, please...&quot;

Don't download this song (Don't do it, no, no)
Even Lars Ulrich knows it's wrong (You can just ask him)
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should (You really should)
Oh, don't download this song

Don't download this song (Oh please, don't you do it)
Or you might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong (Remember Tommy)
Go and buy the CD (Right now) like you know that you should (Go out and buy it)
Oh, don't download this song

Don't download this song (No, no, no, no, no, no)
You'll burn in hell before too long (and you'll deserve it)
Go and buy the CD (Just buy it) like you know that you should (You cheap bastard)
Oh, don't download this song
&lt;/pre&gt;

Album: '''[[Alapalooza]], {{Al|Achy Breaky Song}}'''

==The Song==
*&quot;Achy Breaky Song&quot; is &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic's parody of &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; by Billy Ray Cyrus. The song details a disgruntled listener's disdain for it (&quot;Don't play that song, that achy breaky song...&quot;), as well as several alternatives he would rather endure, rather than having to listen to it anymore. These even include physical torture such as being &quot;tied to a chair and kicked down the stairs&quot;.

==Musicians and Bands Mentioned in the Song==

&lt;pre&gt;
You can torture me
With Donnie &amp; Marie
You can play some Barry Manilow
Or you can play some schlock
Like New Kids on the Block
Or any Village People song you know
Or play Vanilla Ice
Hey, you can play him twice
And you can play the Bee Gees any day
But Mr. DJ, please
I'm beggin on my knees
I just cant take no more of Billy Ray

Don't play that song
That achy breaky song
The most annoying song I know
And if you play that song
That achy breaky song
I might blow up my radio, ooo...

You can clear the room
By playin Debbie Boon
Or crank your Abba Records until dawn
Oh, I can even hear
Slim Whitman or Zamfir
Don't mind a Yoko Ono marathon
Or play some Tiffany
On 8-track or CD
Or scrape your fingernails across the board
Or tie me to a chair
And kick me down the stairs
Just please don't play that stupid song no more

Don't play that song
That achy breaky song
You know I hate that song a bunch
And if you play that song
That nauseating song
It might just make me lose my lunch, ooo...

Don't play that song
That achy breaky song
I think its driving me insane
Oh, please don't play that song
That irritating song
Id rather have a pitchfork in my brain...

Don't play that song
That achy breaky song
The most annoying song I know
And if you play that song
That achy breaky song
I might blow up my radio, ooo-woo...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Hey girl, ya know our economy is in the toilet,
but I'm still gonna treat you right

I said you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Yeah..

Tater tots,
Cold Duck on ice
and we can clip coupons all night
And baby you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Yeah

Take you out for dinner anywhere that you please
Like Burger King or Mickey D's
And baby you can have whatever you like
I said, you can even have the large fries.
Yeah

Baby, you should know I'm really quite a sweet guy
When I buy you bathroom tissue, I always get the two-ply
Water, you can get it, my dear,
I got my Costco membership card right here.
Yeah

You like Top Ramen, need Top Ramen
Got a cupboard full of 'em, I'll keep 'em coming.
You want it, I got it, go get it, just heat it.
Dump the flavor packet on it, and eat it.

Pork and beans
and minute rice
And we can play cribbage all night
and baby you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Yeah

I can take you to the laundromat downtown
And watch all the clothes go round and round
And baby we can go wherever you like
I said we can go wherever you like
Yeah

Hottest shortie I know
If you had some lipo
You could be second-runner-up Miss Ohio
Seven-dollar bills roll
Inside my plastic billfold
Buy you a bagel even if it isn't day-old
And you never ever gonna wear your sister's old clothes
As long as I'm still assistant manager at Kinkos!
Cut your hair with scissors and a soup bowl
You ain't got to to pay me
That's the way I roll

My chick can have what she want.
At Walmart she can pick out anything she want
I know you ain't never had a man like that
Who doesn't make you buy a generic brand like that
Yeah

You like my Hyundai, see my Hyundai?
I can take you to see your cousin Phil next Sunday
But that's kinda far, and I'm not made out of cash
Do you think you could chip in for gas?

Mac and cheese would be alright.
But let's send out for Pizza tonight
And you can order any toppings you like
I said you can even have the last slice
yeah

Ran myself a cable from my neighbor next door.
Now I can get free HBO
And baby you can watch whatever you like
I said you can watch whatever you like
yeah

And you can always ride the city bus
Got a stack of tokens just for us
Yo, My wallet's fat and full of ones.
Yeah, It's all about the Washingtons, that's right

You want White Castle, need White Castle
As long as you got me, it won't be no hassle
You want it, we'll get it, just don't be a hater
If I grab a bunch of napkins for later

Thrift-store jeans on sale half-price
The underwear at Goodwill is nice
And baby you can have whatever you like
I said, you can have whatever you like
Yeah

Baby, I can give you anything you please,
Even share my government cheese,
And baby you can have as much as you like.
I said you can have as much as you like

Yeah.
Yeah...
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Alpocalypse''' is [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]'s 13th studio album. It was Al's first album in five years, being the longest length between an album getting released. The first single released was &quot;[[Whatever You Like]]&quot;, a parody of T.I's &quot;Whatever You Like&quot; in 2008. 4 other of the singles were released in 2009 and Yankovic made an EP out of those 5 tracks named the [[EP:Internet Leaks|Internet Leaks EP.]] He said it was an experiment to see how he could release songs for an album.

The album was released as a CD, Digital Download and Vinyl Record, being the first album since {{Al|UHF - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff}} to be released on record (although {{Al|Straight Outta Lynwood}} had a 12&quot; EP named {{EP|Selections From Straight Outta Lynwood}}.)

Hey
Everyone, listen up
Your attention, if you please

We wanna give you a warning
'Cause I found out this morning
'Bout a dangerous, insidious computer virus

If you should get any mail with the subject &quot;Stinky Cheese&quot;
Better not go taking your chances
Under no circumstances
Should you open it or else it will...

Translate your documents into Swahili
Make your TV record Gigli
Neuter your pets
And give your laundry static cling

(Look out) It's gonna make your computer screen freeze
(Look out) Erase the Easter Eggs off your DVDs
(Look out) Erase your hard drive and your backups too
And the hard drive of anyone related to you

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody

Soon, very soon, it will make all the paint peel off your walls
It'll make your keyboard all sticky
Give your poodle a hickey
And invest your cash in stock in Euro Disney

Then it will tie up your phone making crank long distance calls
It'll set your clocks back an hour
And start hogging the shower
So just trash it now, or else it will...

Decide to give you a permanent wedgie
Legally change your name to Reggie
Even mess up the pH balance in your pool

(Look out) It's gonna melt your face right off your skull
(Look out) And make your iPod only play Jethro Tull
(Look out) And tell you knock-knock jokes while you're trying to sleep
(Look out) And make you physically attracted to sheep

(Look out) Steal your identity and your credit cards
(Look out) Buy you a warehouse full of pink leotards
(Look out) Then cause a major rift in time and space
And leave a bunch of Twinkie wrappers all over the place

That's right, it a...

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Warn all your friends, send this to everybody
Tell everyone you know, tell everybody now

If you get infected, you'll wish you had never been born
So, before it e-mails your grandmother all of your porn

Turn off your computer and make sure it powers down
Drop it in a forty three foot hole in the ground
Bury it completely, rocks and boulders should be fine
Then burn all the clothes you may have worn any time you were online

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody

Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Warn all your friends, send this to everybody
Tell everyone you know, tell everybody now

What are you waiting for?
Just hurry up and forward this to every single person that you know

Hit... &quot;send&quot;... right... now
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't wanna be a Canadian Idiot
Don't wanna be some beer-swillin' hockey nut
And do I look like some frost-bitten hose head?
I never learned my alphabet from A to Zed

They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they all leave the house without packin' heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny?
Their stupid monopoly money
Can't take 'em seriously at all

Well, maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talking a-boot

Sure, they got their national health care
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air
Then again, well they got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of driving a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan

Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out the temperature in Celsius
See the map, they're hoverin' right over us
Tell you the truth, it makes me kinda nervous

Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say &quot;Sorry&quot;
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite
It's gotta be they're all up to something
So, quick, before they see it coming
Time for a preemptive strike
&lt;/pre&gt;

Seven o'clock in the evenin', watching something stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa when my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, &quot;Is this Behind The Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?&quot;
And I say, &quot;I don't know. Say, it's gettin' late, whatcha wanna do for dinner?&quot;

She says, &quot;I kinda had a big lunch so I'm not super hungry.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either, but I could eat.&quot;
She said, &quot;So, what do you have in mind?&quot;
I said, &quot;I don't know, what about you?&quot;
She says, &quot;I don't care. If you're hungry, let's eat.&quot;
I said, &quot;That's what we're gonna do.

But first you've gotta tell me what it is you're hungry for.&quot;
And she says, &quot;Lemme think. What's left in our refrigerator?&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, there's tuna, I know.&quot;
She said, &quot;That went bad a week ago.&quot;
I said, &quot;Is the chili OK?&quot;
She said, &quot;You finished that yesterday.&quot;

I hopped up and said, &quot;I don't know. Do you want to get something delivered?&quot;
She's like, &quot;Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver.&quot;
I'm like, &quot;No, I said delivered.&quot;
She's like, &quot;I heard you say liver.&quot;
I'm like, &quot;I should know what I said.&quot;
She's like, &quot;Whatever. I just don't want any liver.&quot;

Well, I was gonna say something, but my cell phone started to ring
Now, who could be callin' me? Well, I checked my caller I.D.
It was just cousin Larry callin' for the third time today
My wife said, &quot;Let it go to voice mail.&quot;
I said, &quot;OK.&quot;

&quot;Where were we? Oh, dinner, right. So what do you wanna do?&quot;
She says, &quot;Why don't you whip up something in the kitchen?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, &quot;why don't you?&quot;
And then she says, &quot;Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?&quot;
I says, &quot;No.&quot;
She says, &quot;Yes.&quot;
I says, &quot;No.&quot;
She says, &quot;Yes.&quot;
I says, &quot;No.&quot;
She says, &quot;Yes. Oh, here's your keys.&quot;

I step a little bit closer, say, &quot;OK, where you wanna go?&quot;
She says, &quot;How about 'The Ivy'?&quot;
I said, &quot;Yeah, well, I don't know.
I don't feel like gettin' all dressed up and eatin' expensive food.&quot;
She says, &quot;Olive Garden.&quot;
I say, &quot;Nah, I'm not in the mood.
And Burrito King would make me gassy, there's no doubt.&quot;
She says, &quot;Just forget about it.&quot;
I said, &quot;No, I swear I'm gonna take you out.&quot;

Then I get an idea
I say, &quot;I know what we'll do&quot;
She says, &quot;What?&quot;
I say &quot;Guess.&quot;
She says, &quot;WHAT?&quot;
I say, &quot;We're going to the drive-thru.&quot;

So we head out the front door
Open the garage door
Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors

Put my key in the ignition
And then I turn it sideways
And we fasten our seat belts
As we pull out the driveway

Then we drive to the drive-thru (drive-thru)
Heading off to the drive-thru (drive-thru)
We're approaching the drive-thru (drive-thru)
Getting close to the drive-thru (drive-thru)

Almost there at the drive-thru (drive-thru)
Now we're here at the drive-thru (drive-thru)
Here in line at the drive-thru (drive-thru)
Did I mention the drive-thru? (drive-thru) (drive-thru) (drive-thru)

Well, here we are in the drive-thru line, me and her
Cars in front of us, cars in back of us, all just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo with his brights on behind me
I lean out the window and scream, &quot;Hey, whatcha tryin' to do, blind me?&quot;

My wife says, &quot;Maybe we should park. We could just go eat inside.&quot;
I said, &quot;I'm wearin' bunny slippers so I ain't leavin' this ride.&quot;
Now a woman, on a speaker box, is sayin', &quot;Can I take your order please?&quot;
I said, &quot;Yes, indeed you certainly can, we'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.&quot;

Then my wife says, &quot;Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind.
I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time.&quot;
I said, &quot;You always get a cheeseburger.&quot;
She says, &quot;That's not what I'm hungry for.&quot;
I put me head in my hands and scream, &quot;I don't know who you are any more!&quot;

The voice on the speaker says, &quot;I don't have all day.&quot;
I said, &quot;Then take our order, and we'll be on our way.
I wanna get a chicken sandwich and I want a cheeseburger, too.&quot;
She's like, &quot;You want onions on that?&quot;
I'm like, &quot;Yeah, I already said that I do.

Plus we need curly fries, and don't you dare forget it.
And two medium root beers - no, just one, we'll split it.&quot;
Then I said, &quot;I'm guessin' that you're probably not too bright.
So read me back my order; let's make sure you got it right.&quot;

She says, &quot;One: you want a chicken sandwich.
Two: you want a cheeseburger. Three: curly fries and a large root beer.&quot;
&quot;Stop, don't go no further.
I never ordered a large root beer. I said medium, not large.&quot;
Then she says, &quot;We're havin' a special; I supersized you at no charge.&quot;

&quot;Oh (oh).&quot;
And that's all I could say was, &quot;Oh (oh).&quot;
And she says, &quot;Now there's something else (else) that I really think you should know (know).&quot;
&quot;You can have unlimited refills (refills) for just a quarter more (more).&quot;
I say, &quot;Great, except we're in the drive-thru (drive-thru), so what would I want that for (for)?&quot;

Then she says, &quot;Wait a minute. Your voice sounds so familiar. Hey, is this Paul?&quot;
And my wife is all like, &quot;No, that ain't Paul. Now, tell me, who's this Paul?&quot;
She says, &quot;He's just some guy who goes to school with me.
I sat behind him last year and I copied off of him in Geometry.&quot;

I said, &quot;I know a guy named Paul, he used to be my plumber.
He was prematurely bald and moved to Pittsburgh last summer.
He also had bladder problems and a really bad infection on his toe.&quot;
And she says, &quot;Mister, please, you can stop right there.
That's way more than I needed to know.&quot;

And then we both were quiet
And things got real intense
And then she says, &quot;Next window, please.
That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents.&quot;
So we inched ahead in line, movin' painfully slow
I got a little bored, so I turned on the radio

Click - turned it off because my wife was getting a headache
So we both just sat there quietly for her sake
Then I looked at her
And she looked back at me
And I said, &quot;Umm, I think you have something in your teeth.&quot;

She turned away from me and then turned back and said, &quot;Did I get it?&quot;
I said, &quot;Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it, but hey, you know, don't sweat it.&quot;
Then she said, &quot;How 'bout now?&quot;
I said, &quot;Yeah almost.
There's still a little bit there, but don't worry.
It's probably just a piece of toast.&quot;

Now we're at the pay window
Or whatever you call it
Put my hand in my pocket
I can't believe there's no wallet (wallet) (wallet) (wallet) (wallet)

And the lady at the window's like, &quot;Well, well, well.
That'll be five eighty two.&quot;
I turn around to my wife and say, &quot;How much have you got on you?&quot;
She just rolls her eyes and says, &quot;I'll pay for this, I guess.&quot;
So she reaches into her purse and busts out the American Express

I hand it to the lady
And she says, &quot;Oh dear.
It's gotta be cash only.
We don't take credit cards here.

I take back the card and say, &quot;Gee, really? Well that sucks.&quot;
And that's when I found out my wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, &quot;I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today.&quot;
She says, &quot;I never got around to it. So, where's your wallet anyway?&quot;

And I said, &quot;Never mind, just help me to find some change.&quot;
Now the lady at the window's lookin' at me kinda strange
And she says, &quot;Mister, please, we gotta move this line alone.&quot;
I said, &quot;Now hold your stinkin' horses, lady. We won't be long.&quot;

So I looked around inside the glove box
And checked the mat beneath my feet
I found a nickel in an ash tray
And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats

Before long, I had a little pile of coins of every sort
The lady counts it up and says, &quot;You're still about a dollar short.&quot;
And now my woman's got this weird look frozen on her face
She screams, &quot;You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!&quot;

And so I turned around
To the cashier again
I shrugged and said, &quot;OK. Uhh, forget the chicken sandwich then.&quot;

So I pick up my change
Pick up my receipt
And I drive to the pick-up window
Man, I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne-ridden kid, about sixteen
Wearin' a dorky name tag that says, &quot;Hello, my name is Eugene&quot;

And he hands me a paper bag
I look him in the eyes
And I say to him, &quot;Hey, Eugene,
Could I get some ketchup for my fries?&quot;

Well, he looks at me
And I look at him
And he looks at me
And I look at him
And he looks at me
And I look at him
And he says, &quot;I'm sorry.
What did you want again?&quot;

I say, &quot;Ketchup.&quot;
And he says, &quot;Oh yeah, that's right.
I just spaced out there for a second.
I'm really kinda burnt tonight.&quot;

And then he hands me the ketchup
And now we're finally drivin' away
And the food is drivin' me mad
With it's intoxicating bouquet

I'm starvin' to death by the time we pull up at the traffic light
I say, &quot;Baby, give me that burger, I just gotta have a bite.&quot;
So she reaches in the bag and pulls out the burger
And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger

And then I unwrap the paper
I bite into those buns
And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This is the closest thing so far to an original rap song by Weird Al.
* The first thing Al complains about is how he became [[Obesity|Fat]].
* In the animation, the lawyer uses Tom Morello's &quot;Arm the Homeless&quot; guitar with &quot;Homeless&quot; replaced by &quot;Lawyers&quot;.
* The animation is made to match Rage Against the Machines' music videos.
* The end of the video shows the band driving in a car, and when seen from the front the trio looks like the Pep Boys.
* Al's liscence plate says I-SUE-U

&lt;pre&gt;
Jillian was her name
She was sweeter than aspartame
Her kisses reconfigured my DNA
And after that I never was the same

And I loved her even more
Than Marlon Brando loved souffle
She was gorgeous, she was charming
Yeah, she was perfect in every way

Except she was always using the word &quot;infer&quot;
When she obviously meant &quot;imply&quot;
And I know some guys would put up with that kind of thing
But frankly, I can't imagine why

And I told her, I said
&quot;Hey! Are we playing horseshoes, honey?
No, I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
But no cigar!&quot;

Then I met sweet young Janet
Prettiest thing on the planet
Had a body hotter than a habanjero
She had lips like a ripe pomegranate

And I was crazy like Manson about her
She got me all choked up like Mama Cass
She had a smile so incredibly radiant
You had to watch it through a piece of smoked glass

I thought after all these years of searching around
I'd found my soul mate finally
But one day I found OUT she actually owned a copy
Of Joe Dirt on DVD

Oh, no! I said
&quot;Hey! Are we lobbing hand grenades, kiddo?
No I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
Oh, so very close! (Close!)
Yeah, baby, you're close! (Close!)
So close!
But no cigar!&quot;

(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(ALL RIGHT!)

[Hand claps, trumpet solo]

Julie played water polo
She wore a ribbon on her left Manolo
She had me sweating like Nixon every time she was near
My heart was beating like a Buddy Rich solo

And she was everything I've dreamed of
She moved right up to #1 on my list
And did I mention she's a world famous billionaire
Bikini supermodel astrophysicist

Yeah, she was so pretty she made Charlize Theron
Look like a big fat slobbering pig
The only caveat is one of her earlobes
Was just a little tiny bit too big

I said
&quot;Hey! Are we doing government work here?
No I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
So very, very close! (Close!)
Aaw, baby, you're close! (Close!)
So close!
But no cigar!&quot;

Missed it by that much! (No cigar!)
Ah, yeah! Ah, right! (No cigar!)
Really, really, really close! (No cigar!)
But no cigar! 
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Next week on News 62)

He's back, 
and this time, he's mad

Gandhi II

No more pasting resistence
He's out to kick some butt

This is one bad mother,
you don't want to mess with

(Don't move, slave-boy)

He's a one-man wrecking crew

But he also knows how to party

(Give me a steak, medium-rare)

(Yeah, baldy)

There's only one law, his law

Ghandi II

&lt;pre&gt;
Met this fine young thing
At the local Circle K
We made a date for a half past eight
And I said, &quot;What the hey?&quot;

So I journeyed to her crib
And I let myself inside
That chick was slouched down on the couch
I think her brain was fried

Couldn't figure it out
She wouldn't even look at me
Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized
Cold glued to her TV

&quot;Hey, what's your problem baby doll
Let's have a little fling&quot;
She said, &quot;Hey you fool, now just be cool
I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing&quot;

Isle thing
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing

Watchin' all night
Musta, been a marathon
I was bummin', those shows kept comin'
Here's what was goin' on

These Castaways were stranded
On this island out at sea
One of them called Gilligan
Said &quot;Let's name it after me&quot;

He'd mess up every rescue
Man, that first mate was illin'
If I was one of those Castaways
I think I'd probably kill 'im

Just about that time
Telephone began to ring
She said, &quot;Just let it, my machine'll get
We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing

Isle thing
She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing
Please, baby, baby, please

I like the professor
He always saves their butts
He could build a nuclear reactor
From a couple' of coconuts

She said, &quot;That guy's a genius&quot;
I shook my head and laughed
I said, &quot;If he's so fly, they tell me why
He couldn't build a lousy raft&quot;

And while we're on the subject
I'll tell you one thing for sure
Those homeboys brought an awful lot
For just a three hour tour

Then her mom came in the room
It was kind of embarrassing
She said, &quot;Hey you two, I was once like you
And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing&quot;

Isle thing
She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Skipper's in a hammock
He's looking kinda fat
He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit
Old Gilligan with his hat

Mrs. Hal had it goin' on
But Mr. Hal was meaner
Ginger and Mary Anne could've used
Some funky cold medina

I was really diggin' this show
I didn't know what to do
It kinda looked like I was hooked
Now I'm an addict too

I know each episode by heart
Now I'm the rerun king
And on every date we both stay up late
And we watch the Gilligan's Isle thing

Isle thing
Hasta la vista, little buddy
Gilligan's Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''UHF''' was a movie that [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] wrote and starred in. The movie was released July 21, 1989 in the United States.

==Plot==
George Newman (portrayed by Yankovic) is a normal man. Problem is, he's also a daydreamer, who can't keep hold of a steady job. His Uncle Harvey decides George will be the perfect man to manage Channel 62, a station which is losing money and viewers fast. George's imagination is put to good use and he starts thinking up bizarre shows such as &quot;[[Wheel of Fish]]&quot; and &quot;[[Raul's Wild Kingdom]]&quot;. The ratings start to soar again, but not everyone is happy.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

==Reception==
{{Template:Wikipedia}}

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 22 critics.[2]

According to Yankovic's Behind the Music episode, UHF enjoyed one of the most successful test screenings in Orion's history. Orion Pictures released UHF on July 21, 1989 as a hopeful summer blockbuster, hoping that Yankovic would pull them out of the water. However, critical response was negative, and it was out of the theaters by the end of the month.[citation needed] Yankovic has stated that it was not a &quot;critic movie&quot;. As &quot;Weird Al&quot; states in his commentary of the movie, UHF was thought to be the movie that would &quot;save the studio&quot; for Orion. He was treated very well because of this. He states in the commentary: &quot;Every morning I would wake up to fresh strawberries next to my bed. Then, when the movie bombed, I woke up and...no more strawberries!&quot;

Within the month prior, and up to the release of UHF, bigger blockbuster movies like Ghostbusters 2, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman, Licence to Kill, When Harry Met Sally, and Weekend at Bernie's were also released by studios. [3] The draw to these blockbuster movies is also attributable to the lower attendance at UHF's premiere.

UHF has since become a cult classic, becoming very popular on cable and home video.[citation needed] The movie was rereleased in Europe and North America on VHS, but because of the little money earned at the box office, it soon fell out of print. In the several years UHF was out of print, the film developed a cult following, and fans of the film and Yankovic in general pawed desperately for a copy. Prices skyrocketed, ranging from fifty to a hundred dollars or more. Finally, UHF was released on DVD in 2002 by MGM, and in its debut week it became a top ten bestseller in Variety. The North American DVD contains numerous extras including a music video of the movie's theme song, a commentary track featuring director Jay Levey and Yankovic himself (with surprise guest appearances by costar Michael Richards and Emo Philips and a phoned-in appearance by Victoria Jackson), and a deleted scenes reel with Yankovic's commentary.

A webseries called The Real UHF which was heavily inspired by UHF started in 2009, and starred Dr. Demento, Neil Hamburger, and Count Smokula. It featured guest appearances from Devo, George Clinton, and others. The series was the brainchild of Zack Wolk, an intern for Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!

==Goofs==
* When Philo is putting the camera in the ceiling of R.J. Fletcher's office, we see a pencil in his mouth. In the next shot, the pencil's gone.

* When Joe Earley loses his thumb in the table saw and lifts his arm to examine the wound, briefly his thumb can be seen bent underneath his hand.

* When interviewing the shop teacher, the amount of blood on George's shirt changes from shot to shot after being sprayed by the stump.

* Indiana Jones cuts off the left arm of the gunman, but when we see the fake arm lying on the ground it has a right hand. This mistake is mentioned on the DVD commentary.

* When Philo gives the two wires to George, he wears a glove on his left hand. In the shot where he corrects the distance between the wires, the glove is gone.

* When we see the apartment from outside, a car drives in front of the camera, and the camera, the cameraman, and offstage actors are reflected in the side of the car.

* When Stanley Spadowsky is tied up in the broom closet and realizes his beloved mop is in the room with the thugs, he has an orange bandanna around his neck. When he breaks free of his ropes and jumps out of the broom closet, the bandanna disappears.

* Before the shot in which Kuni changes the board to read $75,000, you can see the board changing to read $75,000 over the crowd in the preceding shot.

* When the video of R.J.'s rant is played back by Philo (&quot;This community means about as much to me...&quot; etc.), R.J.'s phrasing at the beginning of the rant doesn't match when he's originally heard saying it earlier in the film.

* During Pamela's live report with the mayor, there is no live truck, and Noodles's camera doesn't have cables or a power supply.

* On a TV commerical for &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot; the time that it says the program comes on is 7:30pm. A few scenes later George is setting up the Fall UHF line up on a magnetic board - and you can see on the board that Stanley Spudosky's Club House comes on every day of the week from 7:00pm to 8:00pm.

==DVD Version==
On the DVD, there are special features such as commentary, deleted scenes, and Behind the Scenes.

===Easter Eggs===
* On the Main Menu, highlight Audio Options, and then press down. The knob will highlight. Press it to see Weird Al in the editing room finishing the movie. Then the movie plays.
* Go to the Audio Setup Screen and highlight Francis then hit left. It should highlight the Red Snapper Fish. Press the fish to see a clip of Stanley Spadowsky in his clubhouse talking to his flowers.
* On the Scene Selection menu, highlight Chapters 13-16 then press down. It will highlight the thing between the knobs. Press it to see a scene from the telethon with Fran.
* On the Special Features Menu, highlight &quot;Commentary&quot; and press left. It will highlight &quot;Watch for falling rocks.&quot; Press it to see a video of Stanley Spadowsky saying &quot;Be there!&quot; &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==Trivia==
* Sections of this movie parody movies such as {{W|Gone with the Wind}} (1939), {{W|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre}} (1948), {{W|Network}} (1976) {{W|Raiders of the Lost Ark}} (1981), {{W|Close Encounters of the Third Kind}} (1977), and {{W|First Blood}} (1982).

'''Wheel Of Fish''' is a fake game show parody of Wheel of Fortune in the movie [[UHF Movie|UHF]]. The game involves martial arts instructor Kuni ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedde_Watanabe Gedde Watanabe]), a&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:20px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;friend of Weird Al's character George Newman, spinning a wheel containing various fishes as prizes. The contestant spins a red snapper, whereupon Kuni asks her if she wants to exchange it for a secret prize hidden in a box. Kuni reveals that the box is empty and chastises her with his catchphrase &quot;You so stupid!&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1475">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
My life, it used to be incomplete
‘Till I saw what I was looking for at a drive-in swap meet
My life it won't be the same again
Now I'm proud to say the king lives on inside my den

Oh, it's all I live for, it's all I need
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis means the world to me

Although he may not be worth much dough
He means much more to me than some old Rembrandt or Van Gogh
Check out those sideburns, there's nothing greater
You can tell that he's no velvet Elvis imitator

Oh, it's all I live for, it's all I need
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis
Oh, now you can't you see
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis means the world to me

In my own private Graceland
In my own little shrine to the king
I don't want nothin' else
No, I don't need anything
Don't need no lava lamp
Don't need no soap on a rope
No pictures of Mexican kids with those really big eyes
Or dogs playing poker

When I'm at home watching my TV
I know the king is always looking down on me
He looks so handsome, he stands so tall
So glad he's big enough to cover up that hole in the wall

(Velvet Elvis) He's so fuzzy
(Velvet Elvis) He's so great
(Velvet Elvis) Never ages
(Velvet Elvis) Never puts on weight
(Velvet Elvis) Look at those rhinestones
(Velvet Elvis) He's just so fine
(Velvet Elvis) You can look but don't touch now
(Velvet Elvis) 'Cause he's mine all mine
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hello, Boys and Girls.
This is a story that I like to call, Peter and the Wolf.
Are you sitting comfortably?
Are you!?
Good, then let's begin....

Each character is represented by a different instrument of the synthesized
orchestra.

For instance, the part of Billy the Bird is played by a flute, like this...

The part of Bruce the Duck is played by an oboe...

Louie the Cat is a clarinet. All right, he's not really a
clarinet. He's just --- you know, he's represented by a clarinet....

The part of the Grandfather will be played by Don Amiche.
He... what?
Can't make it? Oh. Huh.
Okay, um, hmm, in that case, the part of the Grandfather will be played by,
huh, a bassoon....

Three French horns play the part of... uhm... three French horns... uh...

(The Wolf! It's the Wolf!) Right! The Wolf. Seymore the Wolf....

The kettle drum and bass drum represent the sub-machine-gun fire of the
hunters...

And, of course, as always, the part of Bob the Janitor is played by the
accordion.

Well, that's it for the introductions. And now, the story.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... uh.... Oh, excuse me...

Once upon a time --- I think it was last Thursday --- a boy named Peter
opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow.

On the branch of a big tree sat a little bird.
All is quiet, said the bird.
Holy cow! A talking bird!, thought Peter.

Just then, Bruce the Duck came waddling by. Bruce was very happy that Peter
hadn't closed gate and he decided to check out the deep pond in the meadow.

Billy the Bird saw the Duck, so he decided to fly down and pick an argument
with him.

What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?, he said; to which the Duck
cleverly replied, I'm a duck! Stupid!

They argued and argued. The Duck swimming in the pond. The little bird
skipping along the shore. (Scratch) Sorry.

Suddenly, something caught Peter's eye --- and you know how painful that
can be. It was Louie the Cat crawling through the grass.

Louie the Cat thought, If the Bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him.
So quietly, Louie crept towards him on his velvet paws. Well, his paws
weren't really velvet... they were, you know, kind of like velvet. It's
a, what d'ya call it? Uh, a 'metaphor'. It's a metaphor, get it?

Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out! Look
out! Look out! Look out!, advised Peter.

The bird immediately flew up into the tree... while Bruce the Duck quacked
at Louie the Cat... from the middle of the pond.

Louie the Cat walked around the tree and thought, Is it worth climbing up
so high, or should I just send out for pizza?

Grandfather came out. He was all bent out of shape because Peter had gone
into the meadow.

It's a dangerous place. If a Wolf should come out of the forest, then what
would you do, huh?
Peter did not answer, because after all, it was a rhetorical question.

Boys like Peter are afraid of a lot of things, like Nuclear annihilation and
flunking algebra, but they're not afraid of Wolves.

But Grandfather got Peter in a headlock and dragged him home, telling him
that he was grounded and that he couldn't watch any cartoons for three weeks.

Just then, as luck would have it, a big, mean, hairy, ferocious, snarling,
carnivorous Wolf, huh, did come out of the forest!
But I guess we all knew that was coming. I mean, the story is called,
'Peter and the Wolf'. We couldn't very well call it, 'Peter and the Wolf'
if there wasn't any wolf, could we?
Huh, that would be really stupid.

The Cat was up the tree in a twinkling; which is about, oh, 2.3 seconds.

Bruce the Duck quacked so hard that he propelled himself backwards
and up onto dry land.

For those of you taking notes, this is a fine practical example of Newton's
First Law of Motion, which clearly states that for every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction.


But no matter how quickly Bruce tried to waddle away, he couldn't escape
Seymore the Wolf who was wearing his best pair of tennis shoes.

The Wolf was closing in on the Duck. It was getting closer and closer
and closer and then and then....

He got 'em! He got 'em! Oh no! Oh, it was terrible!
Oh, oh I can't believe it! Oh!
The humanity! The humanity! Oh my God! Ahh-hoh, oh, huh.

And then with one big gulp, Seymore 'wolfed' him down. (Burp)

Um, let me recap the story briefly in case you just walked into the room:
Louie the Cat was sitting on one branch. Billy the Bird was on another
branch, not too close to Louie, and Bob the Janitor was at home defrosting
his refrigerator.

The Wolf walked around the tree so many times that he made a small trench.

Meanwhile, Peter was standing behind the closed gate, videotaping everything
that was going on.

Suddenly Peter got an idea. He ran home and got a big spool of his
grandfather's unwaxed dental floss.

One of the branches of the tree that the Wolf was circling was conveniently
stretched out over a high stone wall.

Peter scaled the wall, lickity-split, which is even faster than a twinkling.

Then he grabbed the branch and climbed onto the tree.

Peter said to Billy the Bird, I want you to fly down and circle around the
Wolf's head to distract him, but be very careful he doesn't catch you and
bash your skull in and tear out your lungs and chew you up into itsy-bitsy
teeny-tiny little pieces.

Okay, said the bird.

Billy the Bird almost touched the Wolf's head with his wings while the Wolf
snapped angrily at him. Go ahead, said the Wolf, make my day.

Come on, cut it out, snarled the Wolf, you're askin' for trouble,
Punk. But Billy the Bird just kept on harassing him.

Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso out of the dental floss and, carefully letting
it down, caught the Wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might.

Feeling himself caught, the Wolf got really ticked off and started jerking back
and forth.

Peter tied the other end of the dental floss to the tree and left the Wolf
dangling in mid-air.
Hey, Big Bad Wolf, said Peter, why don't you come up here and get
us now?

I would, said the Wolf, but, well, I'm kinda tied up right now.

Just then, some members of the National Rifle Association came out of the
woods, firing their magnums, uzis and bazookas.

But Peter yelled, Don't shoot. Billy the Bird and I have caught the Wolf.
Now, let's take him to the Zoo.

Great idea!, said the hunters, and if he likes that, next week we'll
take him to Disneyland!

Just imagine the victory parade. Peter was at the head. (Flush)
But after a few minutes he was through and then the parade began with Peter
at the very front.

After him, the hunters leading Seymore the Wolf.

Then Grandfather, and Louie the Cat, and finally, Bob the janitor who had to
sweep up the whole mess.
Grandfather shook his head discontentedly, Well, Peter, what if you hadn't
caught the Wolf? What then?
Well, said Peter, he probably would have ripped out my intestines with
his teeth.
(Cough/gag/choke), said Grandfather, I know that, you idiot.
It was a rhetorical question.

Above them, Billy the Bird chirped proudly. Yeah, that's right. We bad.
We bad.

Granfather decided that he'd had enough of the pond and the meadow and the
whole stinking scene, so he ran off to Los Angeles and joined a Heavy Metal
band.

And what about Bruce the Duck?
Well, the Wolf had been in such a hurry that he swallowed him... alive!
which means the gastric juices slowly disolved his body and he died a long,
painful death.

However, you'll be happy to hear that just a few years later he was reincarnated
as Shirley MacLaine.

And the moral of the story is... oral hygiene is very important. Make sure you
see your dentist at least twice a year 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
This is a new composition which features
A random assortment of all living creatures
You'll find that it's not quite exactly the same
As the one by Camille Saint what's-his-name
Camille, in his research, was slightly behind
And I guess that some critters just plain slipped his mind
So to fill in this void in the Animal Kingdom
I'll read some new verses. I'm not gonna sing them.
So kindly shut up and I'll narrate for you
Carnival of the Animals Part Two

&lt;pre&gt;
Ever wonder what it’s like in Al’s band?
Kind of complicated but we’ll tell you what we can
Lots of people ask us what goes on in Al’s band
This is our song and we’ll start where we began

Back in the beginning before we started
Al sent songs to Doctor Demento
Then met Jon who played the drums and then
He said “we should start a band“
That was the moment the fun began

They met Steve and he became the bass man
He knew Jim who played guitar and then Al had his band
Early on we did a show with Missing Persons
Playing our best but got boo’d by their fans

We cut our first album in three days
After that we knew what to do
We hit the road on tour and then we were on our way
Happy to be playing our music for you

Then before we knew it, we’d started something
We got to make our second album
That’s when Eat It was a hit and went gold
And it changed everything
We had a tour bus at our command

We dared to be stupid on plastic bovines
With ice cream pressed against our foreheads
Johnny Carson asked if we would play polkas on his tv show
We got some help from the Tonite Show band

Polka Party came and went
Featuring Christmas At Ground Zero
And it didn’t chart for too long
But it had some great songs

Then we joined a tour with the Monkees
Going on the road with Mickey Dave and Pete was neat
Even worse the album where we did the fat song
We were too thin to be in the video
UHF was next we played the film score

After that we found our keyboard man
“I am Ruben how do you do?”
We took him in and put him in a cone bra
Now he plays piano and he also plays it cool

Then we went, and jumped off of the deep end
And reached nirvana
And then came Alapalooza
Wearing our horns and silver paint just like the Chili Peppers do
Or did, when we made the Bedrock video

Canada was next in line for Al’s band
That was where we learned how to say Saskatchewan
We were getting popular outside our native land
That opened the door to a world full of fans
So we went to OZ and to New Zealand
When we did bad hair day, the Amish video
We were outstanding in our field
Then we all went, running with the scissors
The saga began and it was more than
All about, pentiums
We were featured on The Simpsons as animated characters
An honor for all of us

Never get, tired of playing in Al’s band
So much fun to play all the styles that we do
How about a solo from the drummer of the band
Take it now Bermuda don’t make it too bland
“I’ll add percussion to lend a hand”

Poodle Hat was different, with Couch Potato
Our first single without a video
But the coup de grace was Genius In France
It was tres magnifique
Al and the band were so very proud

People ask us what it’s like in Al’s band
What it’s like to be in Mr. Yankovich’s band
Then we tell them that it’s Mr. Yankovic’s band
Not a ch the c sounds just like a k

Straight Outta Lynwood we hit top ten
White And Nerdy went platinum too
We really hope that someday we might do it again
If we do we know that it’s all thanks to you
All thank you’s to you
And you’re welcome too
Come and see us play when you can
Then you can see for yourself what is
Making all of this happen
You’re the reason why we play
Haven’t told you everything we do
We’ll have to save it for part two

There’s so much to talk about with Al’s band
Pardon us for rambling it went longer than we planned
That’s a little bit of what it’s like in Al’s band
This is our song come and see us when you can

One big happy family right here in Al’s band
Now that we’ve told you we hope you understand
Why we love to play in Mister Yankovic’s band
This is our song come and see us if you can
&lt;/pre&gt;

Random Voice: Spatula City
Random Voice: Spatula City

Announcer:
A giant warehouse of spatulas for every occasion. Thousands to choose from in every shape, size, and color. And because we eliminate the middle man, we can sell all our spatulas factory direct to you. Where do you go if you want to buy name brand spatulas at a fraction of retail cost?
Random Voice: Spatula City
Random Voice: Spatula City

Announcer:
And this weekend only, take advantage of our special liquidation sale. Buy nine spatulas, get the tenth one for just one penny. Don't forget, they make great Christmas presents. And what better way to say &quot;I love you.&quot; than with the gift of a spatula?
Random Voice: Spatula City
Random Voice: Spatula City

Sy Greenblum:
Hello, this is Sy Greenblum, president of Spatula City. I liked their spatulas so much, I bought the company.

Announcer:
Spatula City - seven locations; we're in the yellow pages under &quot;spatulas&quot;.

Neighbor: My, where did you get that lovely spatula?
Singers: Spatula City: We sell spatulas, and that's all.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Veren zol fun dir a blintsa

(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi

Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho

Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past
But most of 'em were nudniks and none of 'em would last
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick
I tell ya, he's to die for - he really knows his shtick

So how's by you? Have you seen this Jew?
Reads the Torah, does his own accounting too
Workin' like a dog at the synagogue
He's there all day, he's there all day
Just say &quot;Vay iz mir!&quot; and he'll kick into gear
He'll bring you lots of cheer 
and maybe bagels with some shmeer
Just grab your yarmulke and
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly (for a rabbi)

He shops at discount stores, not just any will sufice
He has to find a bargain 'cause he won't pay retail price
He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel
But if you wanna haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!

People used to scoff, now they say &quot;Mazel tov!&quot;
He's such a macher 'cause he worked his tuchis off
Yeah, he keeps his cool and teaches shul
What's not to like? What's not to like?
On high holy days, you know he prays and prays
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise
Put on your yarmulke and
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a bris
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hip
The parents pay the mohel and he gets to keep the tip

(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey
(How ya doin' Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey

Meccha leccha hi, meccha meccha cholly ho

He's doin' well, I gotta kvell
The yentas love him, even shiksas think he's swell
Show up at his home, he says &quot;Shalom&quot;
And &quot;Have some cake - you want some cake?&quot;
Yah, he calls the shots, we really love him lots
Oy gevalt, I'm so ferklempt that I could plotz
So grab your yarmulke
The one you got for Chanukah
Let's put on our yarmulkes and
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!&lt;/pre&gt;

Huh, now lookie here people
Listen to my story
A little story 'bout a man named Jed
You know something?
That poor mountaineer
They say he barely kept his family fed

Now, let me tell you
One day he was shootin'
Old Jed was shootin' at some food
When all of a sudden right up from the ground, there
Well, there came a bubblin' crude

Oil that is Well, maybe you call it black gold or Texas tea
He gonna move next to Mr. Drysdale
And be a Beverly hillbilly...

Before you know it, all the kinfolk are-a-sayin'
Yeah, buddie, move away from there
That little Clampet got his own cement pond
That little Clampet, he's a millionaire

Now, everyone said Californie
Is the place that you oughta be
We got to load up this here truck now
We got to move to Beverly
Hills, that is

Swimming pools
Move-a-move-a-movie stars
Huh
Lookit that, lookit that

Y'all come back now, y'hear?

I got shipwrecked on a deserted island.
Well, long story short...

There's some ladies on the island.
Oh, well the farm girl Mary Ann and red-head Ginger.
(Movie Star)
Well they're both really fine.
(Yes they are)

Yeah, they wanna get busy

They wanna be with me.

I gotta turn em down because it wouldn't be the right thing.

Cuz I'm in love with da Skipper.

&lt;pre&gt;
(Oooh oooh oooh ee-oooh oooh oooh) 
(Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh-oooh oooh)
(Oooooh...) 

I'm always thinkin' 'bout it 
I don't know what I'd do without it 
I love, I really love 
My pancreas 

My spleen just doesn't matter 
Don't really care about my bladder 
But I don't leave home without 
My pancreas 

My pancreas is always 
There for me 
Ahh-oooh 

Secreting those enzymes (bap bap bap) 
Secreting those hormones too 
Metabolizing carbohydrates 
Just for me 

(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) bah (ba-ba-ba) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 
(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba ba bow (ooga-chaka!) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 
(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) (ba-ba-ba) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 
(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba ba bow (ooga-chaka!) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 

(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) bah (ba-ba-ba) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 
(Ooga-chaka!) Ba-ba ba (ooga-chaka!) ba-ba ba bow (ooga-chaka!) My pancreas (ooga-chaka!) 
Oooooh

My pancreas attracts every other pancreas in the universe 
With a force (with a force) (with a force) proportional 
To the product of their masses 
And inversely (Oooh ooh-ooh ooh) proportional 
To the distance between them 

Woo-ooh woo-ooh woo-ooh woooo

Don'tcha you know you gotta flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice? 
Flow, flow, into the duodenum 

Won'tcha flow, flow, flow pancreatic juice? 
Flow, flow into the duodenum 

(Won'tcha flow,) insulin (flow, flow) glucagon (pancreatic juice?) 
Comin' from the islets of Langerhans
(Flow, flow into the duodenum) 

(Won'tcha flow,) insulin (flow, flow) glucagon (pancreatic juice?) 
Comin' from the islets of Langerhans
(Flow, flow into the duodenum) 

Lipase, amylase and trypsin 
(Won'tcha flow,) (insulin) (flow, flow) (glucagon) (pancreatic juice?) 
They're gonna help with my digestion 
(Comin' from the islets of Langerhans)
(Flow, flow into the duodenum)

(Won'tcha flow,) (insulin) (flow, flow) (glucagon) (pancreatic juice?)

Can't you see I love my pancreas? 
(Won'tcha flow,) (insulin) (flow, flow) (glucagon) (pancreatic juice?) 
(Lipase, amylase and trypsin) 
Golly-gee I love my pancreas!

I say, &quot;Don't you know?&quot;

Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be
Gimme, gimme
Living in Berevly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rolling like a celebrity
Gimme, gimme
Living in Berevly Hills

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on
All right already
We'll all float on
Now don't you worry
We'll all float on
All right

Feel good
Feel good

Don't cha?
Don't cha, don't cha, don't cha?

Somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
Well, I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around

Hey
Hey

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, whoa!
I'll take you to the candy shop, yeah
Boy, one taste of what we got, uh-huh
We'll have you spendin' all you got, come on
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, whoa!

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

Come Mr. DJ, song pon da replay

All the gyal pon the floor wantin' some more what
Come Mr. DJ, won't you turn the music up?
Hey mister
Please, Mr. DJ
Tell me if you hear me
Turn the music up

Oh, she's a gold digger (ooh)

* The music video for this song was made right after the one for &quot;[[Smells Like Nirvana]]&quot;. You can tell because of the familiar stage and drums in the background. The janitor from &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; is also seen.
* Robert Goulet makes a cameo in the music video as the piano player who gets an arrow in his eye and his arm chopped off.
* This song is modelled (but not parodied) after “More Than Words” by Extreme.

&lt;pre&gt;
We've been together for so very long
But now things are changing, oh I wonder what's wrong?
Seems you don't want me around
The passion is gone and the flame's died down

I guess I lost a little bit of self-esteem
That time that you made it with the whole hockey team
You used to think I was nice
Now you tell all your friends that I'm the Antichrist

Oh, why did you disconnect the brakes on my car?
That kind of thing is hard to ignore
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore

I knew that we were having problems when
You put those piranhas in my bathtub again
You're still the light of my life
Oh darling, I'm beggin', won't you put down that knife?

You know, I even think it's kinda cute the way
You poison my coffee just a little each day
I still remember the way that you laughed
When you pushed me down the elevator shaft

Oh, if you don't mind me asking, what's this poisonous cobra
Doing in my underwear drawer?
Sometimes I get to thinkin' you don't love me any more

You slammed my face down on the barbecue grill
Now my scars are all healing, but my heart never will
You set my house on fire
You pulled out my chest hairs with an old pair of pliers

Oh, you think I'm ugly and you say I'm cheap
You shaved off my eyebrows while I was asleep
You drilled a hole in my head
Then you dumped me in a drainage ditch and left me for dead

Oh, you know this really isn't like you at all
You never acted this way before
Honey, something tells me you don't love me anymore, oh no no
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore

(after 10 minutes and 2 seconds of silence...)

(some loud and spontaneous noises (the song &quot;Bite Me&quot;))

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1779">The music video for [[Jurassic Park]] was done entirely in claymation. Some notable scenes are:

*Worker digging for amber crystals finds mosquito with oversized eyes and tongue sticking out encased in amber

*Scientist examining mosquito under microscope; sees the DNA cartoon character from the film taking a shower; DNA shrieks and pulls up the shower curtain

*Weird Al trying to hold the kitchen door shut on a velociraptor; raptor pulls out a keychain to open the door

*A bunch of dinosaurs are running loose; one of them is a chicken

*Weird Al in a lab coat in the rain demonstrating his &quot;chaos theory&quot; on a chalkboard

*Brontosaurus steps on a man

*Al in a darkened room with a bunch of hungry dinosaurs; he lights a match but one of the reptiles puts it out

*The tyrannosaur that eats lawyer Donald Gennaro finishes his meal by wiping his mouth with a napkin and then flossing 

*An Arnold Schwarzenegger lookalike shooting dinosaurs with an M-16; tyrannosaurus flattens him 

*Two dinosaurs in wrestling outfits; World Wrestling Entertainment icon can be seen in the corner of the screen

*Tyrannosaur eats Yankovic; as he is traveling down the dinosaurs esophagus he sees dancing/boogeying dinosaurs; also two dinosaurs fighting over a man

*Yankovic lands in the stomach and witnesses a vendor who attempts to sell him an &quot;I Was Eaten Alive at Jurassic Park&quot; t-shirt

*Steven Spielberg (director of the ''Jurassic Park'' film) can be seen with another man and a woman; a tyrannosaur turns to eat them; the man and womans' eyes pop out, Spielberg throws up a sign saying &quot;Cut&quot; and then they all run

*Yankovic angrily stating his disapproval for the park, getting into a helicopter; the helicopter is eaten by a tyrannosaurus as the video ends

&lt;pre&gt;
Sometimes I really wanna be alone...
But that's one state I'm never in...
Because I know that I've got millions upon millions
Of tiny, one-celled organisms living on my skin

(Germs) I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding
(Germs) But they just come right back again
(Germs) I can't even see 'em, but I know they're up to something
Hey, don't touch that - you don't know where it's been

They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get 'em offa me
I'm covered with ... (Microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me?
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with ... (Microscopic bacteria)

Now if I ever dare to go to sleep
That's when they start their sneak attack
In the morning I wake up in utter horror
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque

(Germs) Can't get those parasitic creatures off my face
(Germs) And there's more comin' every day
(Germs) I never said that they could camp out on my body
I wish they'd pack their tiny little bags and move away

They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get 'em offa me
I'm covered with ... (Microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me?
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with ... (Microscopic bacteria)

(Germs) 

(Germs)

(Germs)

(Germs)

(Germs) They're creepin' around my shorts
They're under the bathroom sink
(Germs) They're ridin' inside my car
They're swimmin' in every drink
(Germs) They're hidin' between my toes
They're lurkin' in every kiss
(Germs) I've got 'em way up my nose
In every orifice
(Germs) I'm gonna show them who's boss
I'm gonna get even yet
(Germs) Just gimme some Lysol spray
Just hand me a moist towelette
(Germs) Don't tell me I'm paranoid
I know that they're after me
(Germs) Look under the microscope
See??

They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get 'em offa me
I'm covered with ... (Microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me?
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with ... (Microscopic bacteria)

(Germs) They're all over me
(Germs) I can feel 'em all over me
(Germs) Over every part of me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)

(Germs) I know they're watching me
(Germs) They're always watching me
(Germs) They're comin' after me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)

Won't somebody help me?? (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
Please somebody help me (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
You've got to believe me (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
They're out to get me (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
They wanna control me! (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
They wanna destroy me! (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
They're tryin' to kill me! (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
It kind of upsets me... (Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Oh, my baby, my baby she don't want me no more
Ever since she saw his poster in that record store
She says the way he grinds his molars is really sexy
She thinks he's so darn dysfunctional and &quot;Generation X&quot;y
She likes his brooding angst and his wild-eyed stare
Yeah, he's her very favorite slacker multi-millionaire

Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder
Once she was mine, but now I better just forget her
'Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

Now, every time I see him, well, he looks so grim
I guess it really must suck to be a rock star like him
What a pain in the butt to have so much success
Spending all his time moping and avoiding the press
But my girl can't get enough of his sullen demeanor
Like he's some big tortured genius and I'm some kinda wiener

Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's got a thing for that Eddie Vedder
Tell me, what can he do that I can't do better
Now my baby's in love with

I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
Head over heels for that Eddie Vedder
I cant believe it, now she's knitting him a sweater
'Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

I knew we were headin' for disaster
When she caught me hangin' out at the Ticketmaster
Now she's got an unrequited adoration
For the frustrated, agitated, designated alienated
Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation

Well, I don't wear Doc Martens and I don't wear flannel
And I don't boycott the music video channel
And I just can't compete with all that money and fame
But I know two can play at this game
Yeah, well, let's just see how jealous she'll get
When I start stalking Alanis Morissette

Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her
'Cause my baby's in love with
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
Why'd she have to fall for that Eddie Vedder
If she wants to leave me, I guess I better let her
'Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

Who's that waddlin' down the street
It's just me 'cause I love to eat
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham
Who's real flabby? Yes, I am!
Every picture of me's
Gotta be an aerial view
Now my doctor tells me
There's just one thing left to do

Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Throw out the pizza and beer
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Oh, get those jelly donuts out of here
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Might seem a little severe
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
I'm gettin' tired of my big fat rear
Blow, fatty!

Well, I used to live on chocolate sauce
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss
Walked down an alley and I got stuck
I got more rolls than a pastry truck
When I'm all done eating
I eat a little more
When I leave a room
First I gotta grease the door

Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Can't have another eclair
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
I gotta decrease my derriere

I'm on a Grapefruit Diet
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet

No more pie now
No more creme brulee
Lay off the gravy
And souffle
No french fri-yi-yies now
No ice cream parfait
Mr. Cheese Nacho
Stay away

Oh I think I'd sell my soul
For a triple patty melt
But I need a boomerang
When I put on my belt

Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Lay off the 3 Musketeers
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Until my big booty disappears
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
Eat 'em till they're comin' out of my ears
Grapefruit Diet (Diet!)
'Cause I haven't seen my feet in years

I'm on a Grapefruit Diet
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet

I think I'm about ready for a Quarter Pounder with extra cheese
I need a side order of onion rings
And don't forget to Super-Size that
&lt;/pre&gt;

*Got to eat there, got to eat there
*In the morning
*Where we wouldn't miss it for the world
*Got to eat there, got to eat there
*Bring taste good times
*And show eating is all I do
*Eating is the only feeling I feel
*The moment my stomach feels quisy
*Is when the pain feels agonizing
*I need taste to complete my world for me

*So I've got to eat there
*Got to eat there in the morning
*And eat there all the time
*And show doctors that I have a disorder
*When food says, goodbye world
*I need food sharing my hunger under me

*Thats why I've eat under stress
*Got to be eating where hunger strikes
*And thats everytime I roll
*Ive got to be there so everyone knows
*That I need food within me, all the time

Gee, I'm a nerd
Seen each Star Trek eighty times
Memorized each word

Home alone
On Friday nights
But I got eight gigabytes
Left on my hard drive

I'm hooked as I can get
Into the Internet
Maybe you would like to see my web page

I love my new PC
It means the world to me
So many things to download

Gee, I'm a nerd
All the jocks and muscle heads
Flip me the bird
Cause I'm a nerd

Gee, I'm a nerd
&lt;/pre&gt;

Taco... grande. Taco... grande

Yo quiero chimichangas y chile colorado
Yo tengo el dinero para un steak picado
Las flautas y tamales, siempre muy bueno
Y el chile relleno

You see, I just gotta have a tostada, carne asada
That's right, I want the whole enchilada
My only addiction has to do with a flour tortilla
I need a quesadilla

I love to stuff my face with tacos al carbón
With my friends, or when I'm all alone
Yo tengo mucho hambre y ahora lo quiero
Un burrito ranchero

So give me something spicy and hot, now
Break out the menu, what you got, now?
Oh, would you tell the waiter I'd like to have sour cream on the side
You better make sure the beans are refried

Taco... grande. Taco... grande

Well, there's not a taco big enough for a man like me
That's why I order two or three
Let me give you a tip, just try a nacho chip
It's really good with bean dip

I eat uno, dos, tres, quarto burritos
Pretty soon I can't fit in my Speedos
Well, I hope they feed us lots of chicken fajitas
And a pitcher of margaritas

Well, the combination plates all come with beans and rice
The taquitos here are very nice
Now I'm down on my knees, we need some extra tomatoes and cheese
And could you make that separate checks, please?

Taco... grande. Taco... grande

&quot;Buenos noches, senor. 
bienvenido a el burritos casa de salsa. 
tenemos muchos platos muy sabrosos si puedo 
recomendar el ardiente pollo al infierno muy delicioso. 
sus ojos se quemaran, su estomago estara en fuego, 
se quedaran en el baño por una semana, 
entiendes lo que digo gringo estupido tonto?&quot; 
Well, the food is coming, I can hardly wait
Now watch your fingers, careful hot plate!
What you think you're doing with my chile con queso?
Well, if you want some, just say so

Oh boy, pico de gallo
They sure don't make it like this in Ohio
No gracias, yo quiero jalepeños, nada más
You can toss away the hot sauce

?Donde estan los nachos? Holy frijole!
You better get me a bowl of guacamole
Y Uusted, Eugene? Why's your face turning green?
Don't you like pinto beans?

You want some more cinnamon crispas?
If you don't, hasta la vista
Just take the rest home in a doggie bag if you wanna
You can finish it mañana

Well, it's been a pleasure, I can't eat no more
Señor, la cuenta, por favor
If you ain't tried real Mexican cooking, well, you oughta
Just don't drink the water

Taco... grande. Taco... grande
Taco... grande. Taco... grande
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Let me tell you sonny... let me set you straight
You kids today ain't never had it rough
Always had everything handed to you on a silver plate
You lazy brats think nothing's good enough

Well, nobody ever drove me to school when it was ninety degrees below
We had to walk butt-naked through forty miles of snow
Worked in the coal mines twenty two hours a day for just half a cent
Had to sell my internal organs just to pay the rent

When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age

Let me tell you something, you whiny little snot
There's something wrong with all you kids today
You just don't appreciate all the things you've got
We were hungry, broke and miserable and we liked it fine that way

There were seventy three of us living in a cardboard box
All I got for Christmas was a lousy bag of rocks
Every night for dinner, we had a big ol' chunk of dirt
If we were really good, we didn't get dessert

When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age

Didn't have no telephone, didn't have no FAX machine
All we had was a couple cans and a crummy piece of string
Didn't have no swimming pool when I was just a lad
Our neighbor's septic tank was the closest thing we had

Didn't have no dental floss, had to use old rusty nails
Didn't have Nintendo, we just poured salt on snails
Didn't have no water bed, had to sleep on broken glass
Didn't have no lawnmower, we used our teeth to cut the grass

What's the matter now, sonny, you say you don't believe this junk?
You think my story's wearin' kinda thin?
I tell you one thing, I never was such a disrespectful punk
Back in my time, we had a thing called discipline

Dad would whoop us every night till a quarter after twelve
Then he'd get too tired and he'd make us whoop ourselves
Then he'd chop me into pieces and play Frisbee with my brain
And let me tell ya, Junior, you never heard me complain

When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age
&lt;/pre&gt;

Mom and dad are goin' out for the evening
And you're stuck inside the house all alone
That's when you decide it might be fun to harass someone
Dial a random number up on your telephone

You ask if their refrigerator is runnin'
Then you tell 'em they should go out and catch it
Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from
They'd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet (Listen to me)

Don't go makin' phony calls
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to
I know that you think it's funny drivin' folks right up the wall
But it's really gettin' old fast

Little Melvin has a natural obsession
Askin' for Prince Albert in a can
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call
To some guy he doesn't know who lives in Japan

He's callin' strangers up at three in the mornin'
Gives 'em pizza pie delivery at four
He won't be laughin' when they're tracin his line
One day the phone police will be there at his door (Yo, hear me)

Don't go makin' phony calls
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to (that you're used to)
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall
How long is this phase gonna last? (Come on)

[Moe:] Moe's Tavern - Where the elite meet to drink.
[Bart:] Uh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name Rotch.
[Moe:] Hold on; I'll check.
[Moe:] Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch! Hey, has anybody seen my crotch lately?
[others laughing]
[Moe:] Listen to me you little puke.
[Moe:] One of these days, I'm gonna catch you
[Moe:] And I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an icepick!
[Bart laughing]

Don't go makin' phoney calls
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to
You went through the New York City phone book and prank-called 'em all
Hope that you grow out of this fast

Grow out of this fast...

Don't go makin' phoney calls
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to
Bet you think it's funny when you're drivin' folks right up the wall
But you're just a pain in the ass

The white stuff, The white stuff

The first one was a sweet one
Second one was a blast
Soon I finished off the bag, ate 'em up real fast
You can see 'em in my teeth
Tell it when I talk
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock

I love the white stuff, baby
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff, baby
It's the most delicious thing I know

I've had a zillion or two
In my life, they're so right
My teeth are all rotted clear through
But who cares? What else am I supposed to do?

Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, the white stuff
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo
What's in the middle? The white stuff

The first time that I tried it
Got a big sugar buzz
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does
But I love the filling most
I rub it on my roast
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast

I love the white stuff, baby
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff, baby
Take some with me everywhere I go

Might get a pimple or two
Well, so what? It's all right
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs won't do
All I need... You know what it is

Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, the white stuff
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, the white stuff
Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo
What's in the middle? The white stuff

==Trivia==
* This song is about a cartoon called {{W|The Flintstones}}. Bedrock is the town where the Flintstones live.
* {{W|Dick Van Patten}} appears briefly in the music video.
* The music video was shot in a real patch of desert.
* The Bee Girl from the Blind Melon video appears at the beginning of the music video.
* This is one of the many [[&quot;Weird Al&quot;]] songs where the theme is [[Television]].
* Some people on YouTube mistake it for being it a parody of Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, but there were multiple reasons for not being a parody of LMFAO: The fact that this parody was made in 1993 and Party Rock Anthem was made in 2010 and that the fact that LMFAO wasn't around until 2006.

&lt;pre&gt;
Aquarius
There's travel in your future when your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus
Fill that void in your pathetic life by playing Whack-A-Mole seventeen hours a day

Pisces
Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos with the Ebola virus
You are the true Lord of the Dance, no matter what those idiots at work say

Aries
The look on your face will be priceless when you find that forty pound watermelon in your colon
Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf, then give a hickey to Meryl Streep

Taurus
You will never find true happiness - what you gonna do, cry about it?
The stars predict tomorrow you'll wake up, do a bunch of stuff, and then go back to sleep

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

Gemini
Your birthday party will be ruined once again by your explosive flatulence
Your love life will run into trouble when your fiance hurls a javelin through your chest

Cancer
The position of Jupiter says you should spend the rest of the week face down in the mud
Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose while taking your driver's test

Leo
Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt and staple it to your boss's face, oh no
Eat a bucket of tuna-flavored pudding, then wash it down with a gallon of strawberry Quik

Virgo
All Virgos are extremely friendly and intelligent - except for you
Expect a big surprise today when you wind up with your head impaled on a stick

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

Now you may find it inconceivable or at the very least a bit unlikely that the relative position of the planets and the stars could have a special deep significance or meaning that exclusively applies to only you, but let me give you my assurance that these forecasts and predictions are all based on solid, scientific, documented evidence, so you would have to be some kind of moron not to realize that every single one of them is absolutely true.

Where was I?

Libra
A big promotion is just around the corner for someone much more talented that you
Laughter is the very best medicine, remember that when your appendix bursts next week

Scorpio
Get ready for an unexpected trip when you fall screaming from an open window
Work a little harder on improving your low self-esteem, you stupid freak

Sagittarius
All your friends are laughing behind your back (kill them)
Take down all those naked pictures of Ernest Borgnine you've got hanging in your den

Capricorn
The stars say that you're an exciting and wonderful person, but you know they're lying
If I were you, I'd lock my doors and windows and never never never never never leave my house again

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (yay yay yay yay yay)
That's your horoscope for today
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Sometimes I feel
Like I need a vacation
Sometimes I feel
Like I wanna go
To the city of cavemen
The city of Bedrock
I'd be a Flintstone
Now I'll tell you why...

Well, I've got I've got a woman named Wilma
Well, I've got I've got a baby named Pebbles
Well, I've got I've got a doggy named Dino
We do a little bowling and we drink a little vino

Well, I've got a little buddy, Barney Rubble
Got a neighbor by the name of Barney Rubble
He's a midget but he makes a lot of trouble
Doesn't like to shave, he got caveman stubble

Me and Barney, Loyal Order Water Buffalo
Lodge brothers, Loyal Order Water Buffalo
There's a handshake everybody gotta know
How come grand Poo-Bah always gotta run the whole show?

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
I get by on all my prehistoric knowhow

Betty and Barney got a baby named Bamm-Bamm
Little Pebbles is his number one fan
He's the strongest toddler in the whole land
Tear your arm off if he shakes your hand

Got a car, gonna push it with my feet now
Gonna take my family out to eat now
Jumbo ribs at the drive-in can't be beat now
Made from brontosaurus, baby, not a moo-cow

Wanna chill with a Sabretooth Tiger
Wear a loincloth, natural fiber
Be the first Rolling Stone subscriber
Got a pterodactyl for a windshield wiper

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Don't know what it means but I say it anyhow

Luck me, workin' down in the gravel put
Movin' rocks, on a big dinosaur I sit
Mr. Slate gets mad and he throws a fit
Pull the birdie's tail, everybody knows it's time to quit

I realize I'm living in the Stone Age
No fax, no cellular phone-Age
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone-Age
Liftin' heavy boulders every day for my wage

Barney Rubble, laughin' like a hyena
Barney Rubble, what a little wiener
Where's Wilma? Anybody seen her?
Got a baby elephant vacuum cleaner

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now

Yabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba do now

(Yabba dabba do!) Yabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba do now
(Yabba dabba do!) Yabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba do now

(Yabba dabba do!) Yabba dabba do now [Barney laughing]
Yabba dabba do now
(Yabba dabba do!) Yabba dabba do now [Barney laughing]
Yabba dabba do now

[Barney laughing]
(All right, all right)
(Oh boy)

&lt;pre&gt;
It's been one week since we got to see
Cheatin' lovers and cousins that marry
Five days since they had the show
With the hermaphrodite, the slut, and the crack ho
Three days since we heard the tale
About the guy who learned his woman was a she-male
Yesterday it occurred to me
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer

Holy cow, d'you see it last week?
Well, they had this one freak
Who sucker-punched his whole family
Do you recall when the brawl
Became a total free-for-all
And Jerry's in the middle tryin' to be the referee
Hey, see the stripper with the implants
She likes to lap dance
And date the boyfriend of her mother
Now here come's Jerry's next guest
And it's a slugfest
'Cause it's her trailer trash brother
Nymphomaniac is back on crack
It's like &quot;When Animals Attack&quot;
They all exhibit reprehensible behavior
Hit 'em in the nose, tear off their clothes
Step on their toes, that's how it goes
They get so violent they have to sign a waiver

They're always swearin', cursin', kickin' butt, and pointin' blame
On the air? They don't care, they've got no shame
There was one guy who I'm sure felt a little strange
When he found out that his wife had a sex change
They have a tendency to scream and yell constantly
They have a history of ripping off their shirts

It's been one week since they had the fight
With the Siamese twins and the transvestite
Five days since that awful brawl
They still haven't got the blood off the wall
It's been three days since the bitter fued
Between the KKK and that gay Jewish black dude
Yesterday, finally dawned on me
I'm spendin' way too much time on that Jerry Springer

Guy Guest : Baby, I've been sleepin' with your sister
Gal Guest : Oh? Well, which one?
Guy Guest : All of them
Gal Guest : Oh! Well, I've been sleepin' with your best friend Jake!
Guy Guest : Yah? Well, well me too!
Gal Guest : Oh!
Guy Guest : And I've sleepin' with your dog Woofie!
(barking)
Gal Guest : Woofie, you b-tch!
Gal Guest : Well, I'm also sleepin' with your pet goat!
(baaahhing)
Guy Guest : That goat doesn't love you!

Once you start watchin', there's just no stoppin'
Your brain shuts down, then your IQ's droppin'
Jerry's the king of confrontation
He's a sensation
He puts the 'sin' in syndication
It's totally worthless, like a bad check
It's like a train wreck
Don't wanna stare but you can't look away
Like Sally Jesse he does talk shows
But with more weirdos
The ratings jumpin' higher everyday
If you've seen the show, well then you know
It's just as low as you can go
The guests are tacky and they're lacking in their hygiene
And pretty soon some ugly goon
Comes in the room and then it's BOOM
In the face of some unsuspecting drag queen

Well it's the kind of show where people scream obscenities
Yankin' hair, throwin' chairs at their hubbies
&quot;Jerry! Jerry!&quot; Now the crowd starts their favorite chant
Should I turn off my TV? I just can't
I have a tendency to watch it religiously
I have a history of taping each one

It's been one week since the show about
Psycho killers with problems they should work out
Five days since the big surprise
When some loser's wife said she's still dating twenty guys
Three days since he interviewed
A bunch of psychic porn star midgets who were all nude
Yesterday, it occurred to me
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer
Tired of wastin' my time on that Jerry Springer
I've got way too much class to watch Jerry Springer
Come over here and pull on my finger
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I was watching my TV one night when they broke in with a special report
About some devastating earthquake in Peru
There were thirty thousand crushed to death, even more were buried alive
On the Richter scale it measured 8.2

And I said, &quot;God, please answer me one question?&quot;
&quot;Why'd they have to interrupt 'The Simpsons' just for this?&quot;
What a drag, 'cause I was taping it and everything
And now I'll have to wait for the rerun to see the part of the show I missed

Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
(Why) Why does this always happen to me?

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba

I was driving down the highway when all the traffic slowed to a crawl
There was a twelve-car pile-up, everybody dead
And I saw brains and guts and vital organs splattered everywhere
As well as my friend Robert's disembodied head

And I thought - Poor Rob, I just had lunch with him
Hey, wait a minute, he still owes me money - what a jerk
Well, there's five bucks that I'm never gonna see again
Plus now, on top of everything else, it looks like I'm gonna be late to work

Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
(Why) Why does this always happen to me?

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba

Oh, the other day, my boss said we were running low on toner
And he told me I should buy another case
Well, I told him I was busy, but he still just kept on asking
So, I turned around and stabbed him in the face (right in the face)

Oh, and wouldn't you know it, my knife got stuck
I guess that's probably bound to happen now and then
But I'm afraid I may have bent the tip a little
And I know that blade will never ever be quite as sharp again (quite as sharp again)
Oh, tell me

Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?

Why does this always happen to me?
(Why does this always happen to me?)
Why does this always happen to me?
(Why does this always happen to me?)

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba

Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3113">==Intro==

This decade was really big for Al, as it made him the most successful parodist on Earth.

==The Final Days of the 70s==
Weird Al Yankovic recorded his first single [[My Bologna]], a parody of The Knack's &quot;My Sharona&quot; in the men's room in his college in December 1979. The single didn't bring much success to Al, but it was a great start to a great future for him.

==The Early 80s==

===1980-1982===
After barely any success from 1979's [[My Bologna]], Al recorded his second single in 1981: [[Another One Rides The Bus]]. The song was very successful in the early part of the decade. He even went live on The Tomorrow Show to perform a slightly faster version of the song with [[Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz]].

===1983===
With the success from his first two singles, he recorded a few more singles in 1983. With his first two singles and the new singles, he created his first album: {{Al|&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic}}. Some of the songs on this album include: [[Ricky]] (1983), [[I Love Rocky Road]] (1983), [[Another One Rides The Bus]] (1981), and [[My Bologna]] (1979).

==The Mid 80s==

===1984===
The next part of this decade was even better for Al, giving him even more success. He wrote even more singles in 1984-85 and his next two albums: [[In 3-D]] and [[The Food Album]]. 

Al released [[Theme From Rocky XIII]] and [[Eat It]], his first single to make the Billboard Hot 100 at #12 in 1984. [[Eat It]] was Al's most successful single until 2006's [[White and Nerdy]], which reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100.

With more success in 1984, Al released [[This Is The Life]] and [[I Lost On Jeopardy]], which had a music video featuring the original 1980s settings and the original host from 25 years ago.

===1985===
He released [[Like A Surgeon]] in 1985. This song was actually requested by Madonna herself, as a parody of her hit single &quot;{{W|Like a Virgin}}&quot; (1984). This marked the first time that the original artist requested a parody of his or her own song. There are several similarities between the two music videos for the Like a Surgeon and Like a Virgin. For example, there is a lion in the beginning of both videos.

[[Hooked On Polkas]] was Al's first polka medley song released in 1985. The songs in this polka are classics from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, even though Al usually parodies &quot;modern&quot; (1985 modern) songs from the era that he writes and releases the parody.

===1986-1987===
Al released [[Dare To Be Stupid]] and [[Living With A Hernia]] in 1986, as well his album {{Al|Dare To Be Stupid}}. He also released his first Christmas single [[Christmas At Ground Zero]] in November of 1986.

==1988 and 1989==

===1988===
Al released [[Fat]], his second Michael Jackson parody in 1988, as well as [[Lasagna]] and [[I Think I'm A Clone Now]], as well as his album {{Al|Even Worse}}.

===1989===
Al went to Hollywood to star in the film [[UHF (film)]] in 1989. He also released the title song and the soundtrack to his film. One of the songs on this album is [[Money For Nothing/ Beverly Hillbillies]], released in August of 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1320">==The First Five Years==

===1990-1992===
It wasn't until 1992 when Al released his next album: {{Al|Off The Deep End}}. Also released included: [[Smells Like Nirvana]] (a parody of Nirvana's &quot;{{W|Smells Like Teen Spirit}}&quot;) and [[Taco Grande]].

===1993-1994===
Al released [[Achy Breaky Song]], one of his best-known and insulting songs in 1993. Also released included: [[Bohemian Polka]], another polka medley; [[Jurassic Park]], a song telling the story of Jurassic Park; and [[Bedrock Anthem]], a Flintstones-themed song; all on the album {{Al|Alapalooza}}.

He released only one single- [[Headline News]] in 1994.

==The Final Five Years==

===1995-1998===
The late 1990s was more quiet for Al, until he released [[Amish Paradise]], [[Gump]], [[Spy Hard]], and [[The Night Santa Went Crazy]] all in 1996. 1997 and 1998 were quiet for Al, as he was probably planning to get new ideas for the future.

===1999===
But in 1999, Al released his next album: {{Al|Running With Scissors}}. Some of the singles on this album include: [[Polka Power!]], [[Pretty Fly For A Rabbi]], and [[The Saga Begins]].

1999 was also big for Al when he changed his hair and got LASIK Surgery, transforming from his &quot;Classic Look&quot; to his modern look, which he kept through the 2000s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="899">The 2000s was much quieter than the 80s or the 90s for Weird Al. He only released two albums since 2000, as he didn't record anything for six whole years (below).

==Hiatus: 2000-2005==
Al took at six year hiatus from 2000 to 2005 after his LASIK and his hair change from 1999.

==2006: Straight Outta Lynwood==
{{Al|Straight Outta Lynwood}} was released in 2006 along with Al's most successful single ever: [[White &amp; Nerdy]], which placed at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100, beating 1984's [[Eat It]], which made #12. This song became Al's first Top 10 single ever.

==The Rest of the Decade==
Al made another cameo on [[The Simpsons]] in 2008, with the song [[Brain Freeze]].

Al released [[Whatever You Like]] in October of 2008. This song was the first song that Al copied the title of the original song ({{W|T.I.}}'s &quot;{{W|Whatever You Like}}&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="712">'''Obesity''' is when someone is morbidly overweight. Being overweight, or fat is the subject of quite a few of &quot;Weird Al&quot;'s songs. Some of &quot;Weird Al&quot;'s songs mention about obesity but the song itself isn't about obesity. (Example: [[I Love Rocky Road]])

==Appearances==
* [[Fat]]
* [[Fatter]]
* [[Grapefruit Diet]]
* [[I'll Sue Ya]] (...and I got '''fat!''')
* [[I Love Rocky Road]] (And if I get '''fat'''...)

&lt;pre&gt;
Late at night, youre hungry
Youre craving some pizza
Let me be the one that you call

Olive or anchovy
Perhaps pepperoni
Anything you want, weve got it all

Near, far, Ill jump in my car
You just call in your order and Im gone
You know, we hand toss our dough
Just tell me what you want and the toppings will go on and on

Deep dish, whatever you wish
Even get two for one with a coupon
You must try our special crust
But just dont eat too fast or your heartburn will go on and on
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Al's involvement==

&lt;pre&gt;
I woke up this morning
Then I went back to bed
Said I woke up this morning
Then I went right back to bed
Got a funny kind of feelin' like I got broken glass in my underwear
And a herd of wild pigs is trying to chew off my head
You know what I'm sayin'

Well I ain't got not money
I'm just walkin' down the road
Said I ain't got no money, honey
So I'm just walking down this lonely old road
Well, I wish I could get me some money
But I forgot my automated teller code

I was born in a paper sack in the bottom of a sewer
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast, my family was so poor
My daddy was a waitress, my mama sold bathroom tiles
My brothers and sisters all hated me 'cause I was an only child

I got the blues so bad, woo
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead

I'm just a no good, scum sucking, nose picking, boot licking, sniveling, groveling, worthless hunk of slime

Nothing but a low-down beer bellied, bone headed, pigeon toed, turkey necked, weasle faced, worthless hunk of slime

Guess I pretty low self image
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something -- I
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time
Make it talk
Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk
OK, now make it shut up

Plagues and famine and pestilence always seem to get me down
I always feel so miserable whenever I'm around
I wish somebody would come along, stick a pitchfork through my brain
I'd flush myself right down the toilet, but I'd just clog up the drain

I got the blues so bad
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama
Or maybe I'll go bowling
Or I just might go bowling
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid looking shirt and go bowling instead
Yeah
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
If I could stick my hand in my heart
Spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy you
Would it slide on by you
Would you think the boy is strange
Ain't it stra-a-ange

If I could win
If I could sing
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried
If I cri-i-ied
I said, &quot;Ah no, It's only rock 'n' roll
But I like it
Ah no, it's only rock 'n' roll
But I like it, like it
Yes I do
I really really really really do do-do do do&quot;
Hey

Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' all right
Hear they whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar
How come you taste so good
Brown sugar
Just like a young girl should

I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would make her connection
By her feet was a footloose man

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
You might find
You get what you need

You need honkey tonk women
Gimme gimme gimme the honkey tonk blues

Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
The girl who once pushed me around
It's down to me
Yes it is
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb

So, goodbye ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still, I'm gonna miss you

Who who who who who-who who who who who who-who who who who-who
Who who who who who-who who who who who who-who who who who-who

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste (woo woo)
I've been around for a long long year
So many a man sold a faith (woo woo)
Pleased to meet you (woo woo)
Hope you guessed (woo woo) my name (woo woo woo woo)
'Cause what's bothering you (woo woo)
Is the nature (woo woo) of my game (woo woo woo woo)

I said, &quot;Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Don't hang around because two's a crowd

Sha-doo-bee, shattered, sha-doo-be, shattered

Laughter, joy, and loneliness
And sex and sex and sex and sex
Look at me
I'm in tatters
Sha-doo-bee, I'm shattered
Sha-doo-bee, shattered

This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my
Let's spend the night together
No excuses offered anyway, oh my
Let's spend the night together
I'll satisfy your every need (every need)
And I know you'll satisfy me
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma ma ma my

I can't get no
Satisfaction
I can't get no
Girlie action
'Cause I try (and I try) and I try (and I try)
And I try (and I try) and I try (and I try)
I can't get no
I can't get no
I can't get no
Satisfaction
Satisfaction
Satisfaction
Satisfaction
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Where'd you learn how to steer
You do eighty in second gear
When you drive, I can't relax
Got your license from Cracker Jacks
You just hit another tree
These fender benders are killin' me

She drives like crazy
Like no one else
She drives like crazy
And I'm afraid for myself

They'll put you behind bars
We're not playin' bumper cars
Did a great figure eight
In the middle of the interstate
Tires squeal wherever we go
Even hitchhikers just say no

She drives like crazy
Her car's a mess
She drives like crazy
She's got a death wish I guess

She's a demon
Behind the wheel
Thinks she's drivin'
The Batmobile

Burnin' rubber in school zones
Runnin' over the traffic cones
Passin' &quot;semi-&quot;s on the right
Now my knuckles are turnin' white

She drives like crazy
She'll break our necks
She drives like crazy
She always gets into wrecks

She drives like crazy
Like no one else
She drives like crazy
Now I'm afraid for myself

She drives like crazy
Like no one else
She drives like crazy
And I'm afraid for myself
&lt;/pre&gt;

Met this pretty young stewardess on a non-stop flight
She showed me to my seat and it was love at first sight
Now lately I've been flying to all kinds of places
That I never really wanted to go
'Cause I'll do anything just to spend a little time
With the cutest flight attendant I know

You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy

Every one of our dates is at thirty thousand feet
She always points out the exits to me, she's so sweet
You know she gets me my headphones for free
Refills my coffee cup whenever I ask
And you gotta admit my baby looks pretty hot
When she's wearin' that oxygen mask

Well well, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy

Amy, darlin', don't you know you really drive me nuts
Every time you're handing out those honey roasted peanuts
Airline Amy, this is my new mission
Gotta get you in an upright locked position

Oh yeah, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy
Yeah yeah, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
You're the only woman I desire, Airline Amy Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher
No one else can take me higher
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
It took a lifetime, but I finally found
The perfect waffle recipe
You'll never find a batter any better in this whole stinkin' town
One little bite and I'm sure that you'll agree

Your eyes roll back and your knees get weak
Aw, you're gonna lick your plate clean
People come from miles around just to study my technique
I make the best darn waffles this world has ever seen

I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)... yeah
Waffle King (Waffle King)
That's what they call me
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Hey, I'm the Waffle King

Everywhere I go, the people cheer
I never have to wait in line
People say, &quot;Right this way, sir... Your money's no good here.'
Some day I betcha they'll build me a shrine

And everybody say, &quot;Well, I'm your biggest fan!&quot;
&quot;I seen your picture in People Magazine!&quot;
Folks come from around the world just to shake my hand
If you don't believe in the power of the waffle lemme show you just what I mean

I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)
Make you want to scream and shout
Waffle King (Waffle King)
That's my name, don't wear it out
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Make no mistake about it I'm the Waffle King... yeah

Roll out the red carpet, 'cause here I come
All you peons better scram
Out of my way, you worthless piece of scum
Don't you know who I am?
Hey!

I wanna see you grovel, you waffle-eatin' fools
Everybody, on your knees
You wanna buy a waffle, you're playin' by my rules
Go on, beg me... lemme hear you say &quot;pretty please&quot;

Can't you tell the universe revolves around me?
Don't you know you suckers owe me everything?
And can't you see that I'm the highest form of life that there could ever be?
Everybody all around the world, stand up and sing
Come on now...

Waffle King
Hey, batter batter
Waffle King
Hot on your platter
Waffle King
Say, what's the matter

Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?

Tell 'em, girls
(He's the Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Waffle King)
Yeah yeah
(He's the Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Waffle King)
Tell the truth now
(He's the Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Wa Waffle King)

Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?

I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)
Step aside, I'm coming through
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Hey, what's the matter with you?

Listen pal
You can kiss my royal butt (Waffle King)
Don't you know who I am?
You've got to be kidding me
I'm the Waffle King
&lt;/pre&gt;

Polka Party! is [[Weird Al]]'s fourth studio album released in 1986. The album sold terribly, and is generally considered by his fans his worst album. It nearly destroyed Weird Al's career as well. The album created 2 singles titled {{Sg|Living With A Hernia}} and {{Sg|Christmas At Ground Zero}}. The album was originally released on Vinyl, Cassette and CD making it the first first Weird Al record to have a CD release in its release year with the last three albums being re-issued on CD later. The album was re-issued in 1999 on CD by the label Volcano Records.

Polka Party was a commercial failure. It received mixed reviews, and did not receive a Gold or Platinum award from the RIAA. The album only got a 177 spot on the Billboard 100 even with the single Living With A Hernia promoting it, with even the single not doing well in the charts. 

The music on Polka Party is made upon parodies and style parodies of pop and rock music of the 80s. The album also includes style parodies. There is five originals, 4 parodies and 1 polka song.

&lt;pre&gt;
You gotta keep 'em separated

You like the latest fashions
You'd like to keep 'em clean
You take a trip every week to the laundromat
Throw a load in the washing machine

But if you don't wanna ruin your clothes
You gotta sort 'em out first as everyone knows
Remember bright colors and the others don't mix
Before you wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up
Hey

Are your undies turning pink
Take 'em out (You gotta keep'em separated)
Hey, are your cottons gonna shrink
Sort 'em out (You gotta keep'em separated)

Hey, then when it's time
You can stick' em in the dryer
You can hang 'em on a line
Hey, it's laundry day
&lt;/pre&gt;

*  Although Michael Jackson was a big fan of Al's parodies, and had previously allowed him to make parodies of &quot;[[Fat|Bad]]&quot; and &quot;[[Eat It|Beat It]]&quot;, he refused to let him parody this, because Michael thought &quot;Black or White&quot; was more of an important song.

&lt;pre&gt;
I'm never satisfied with three meals a day
While the world is sleeping I'll be munching away
Gonna sneak into the kitchen, gonna tiptoe down and turn on the light
Right, yeah, if no one's around to see you
It don't matter if you snack all night

A million chicken bones are under my bed
A pile of Twinkie wrappers all 'round my head
Jelly doughnuts to the left of me
Got a bag of chocolate chips on the right
Right, yeah, if you don't mind the calories
It don't matter if you snack all night
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Since I was three I had ADHD
Got in trouble constantly
Said, &quot;Just gotta be me! &quot;
Nineteen years later I've got this piece of paper
It says &quot;congrats you're a broke English major&quot;
I still live with Mom and Dad and it's kind of sad
When this Stanford grad brings ladies to his pad
&quot;What up girl? &quot;
&quot;Aren't you that rapper with that song about Hot Topic? &quot;
Maybe Bukowski was right about women? &quot;Ha ha, stop it!
This is an old-school jam, I'm dropping knowledge like Plato
While most rappers track it backwards and stay flat like Play Dough
But I'm a Minor Threat
I flip scripts so they know
You can't taze me bro (&quot;Don't taze me bro! &quot;)
Not to conceal
Keep it surreal
Piss off the British press when I'm like, &quot;Who's John Peel? &quot;
The NME says, &quot;Lars is well rubbish, his single is bollocks&quot;
But I know that they love this!

I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
It's my self-referential introduction song
You know the deal (true player for real!)
I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)

The name's MC Lars now you know the deal (true player for real)

Once upon a time Grandmaster Flash inspired these nerds with a culture clash
Once Run-DMC mixed rock guitars with the kick, snare, kick, kick, snare
Public Enemy took a political stand
Now we pirate these records like damn the man
NWA got attacked by the media
Now we check the facts up on Wikipedia
Can't get on stage at the Jay-Z show
So we boot up ProTools and bust a funky flow
Online for free we don't make dough
Okay just thought I'd let you know
And I can give you twenty-seven reasons why
Post-punk rhymes are just as fly
As anything born from mainstream rap
'till my laptop dies and I'll take that back

I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
Still my self-referential introduction song
You know the deal (true player for real)
I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
The name's MC Lars, I'll smack a rock star (true player for real!)
True player for real

Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, I stay &quot;Self-Reliant&quot;
Genre-defiant, all ages shows with Kobe Bryant
I just checked billboard
My album's in the charts
I think therefore I SoundScan, right Descartes?
But am I a culture thief making hip-hop sound white?
Haven't got the right like, Lancelot the Knight?
No, Camelot's a myth and Guinevere's a slut
So I'll jump into this mosh pit
Pants sagging like &quot;What! &quot;

(Key change)
I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
That's my self-referential introduction song
Now you know the deal (true player for real)
I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
The name's MC Lars, TPFR
True player for real

I kill it on stage with two DI's, why?
Post-punk laptop rap is the new DIY (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real)
I kill it on stage with two DI's, why?
Post-punk laptop rap is the new DIY
TPFR (true player for real)
TPFR (true player for real)
True player... true player&lt;/pre&gt;

==Relations to voice actor==

* He once made a quote to his famous song when he says: &quot;I [[Dare To Be Stupid]]&quot;.
**This is also his own catchphrase in real life.

* In the second episode of Transformers Animated Wreck-Gar appears in called &quot;Human Error, Part 2&quot; he is seen playing the accordion as a counterattack which is Al's favorite instrument.
[[File:200px-TFA Wreck-Gar and Al with Accordions.jpg|thumb|right|Both characters playing accordians.]]

* The toy version of Wreck-Gar's face is given an expression made to make him look like Weird Al

* In the [http://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie 1986 Transformers movie] as soon as he comes out to attack, the song is playing in the background. However he was played by Eric Idle in G1.

==Trivia==
* Craigslist is a centralized network of online communities, featuring free online classified advertisements – with sections devoted to jobs, housing, personals, for sale, services, community, gigs, résumés, and discussion forums. Read more [[Wikipedia:Craigslist|here]].

* In this song, Al describes his various interactions with the site, including meeting a &quot;blonde half-Asian with a bad case of gas&quot; in the site's Missed Connections category.
* Al mentions many things that people try to get rid of on Craigslist, such as a 1965 Chevy Malibu, a slightly-used sombrero, a wheelbarrow, a stapler, and a trash can full of styrofoam peanuts.
* Doors keyboardist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Manzarek Ray Manzarek] was brought on board to recreate the music style for the song.
* When performing the song live, bassist Steve Jay will stand next to the keyboardist and play the bass part on one of the keyboards.  This is a parody of the Doors' live shows, in which they played without a bassist (keyboardist Ray Manzarek would play all songs' bass lines on a Fender piano bass).

&lt;pre&gt;
You've got a '65 Chevy Malibu
With automatic drive
A custom paint job too

I'll trade you for my old wheelbarrow
And a slightly used sombrero
And I'll even throw in a stapler if you insist...

Craigslist!
I'm on Craiglsist, baby, come on!
Yeah!

Well we shared a quick glance
Saturday at the mall
I never took a chance
Never approached you at all

You were a blonde half-Asian with a bad case of gas
I was wearin' red speedos and a hockey mask
Come on let's find that love connection that we missed

On Craigslist!
Yeah, Craigslist, come on!
I'm on Craigslist
Oh, baby, maybe you are too!
Be bom ba chomb cadonk bin bam boo!

An open letter to the snotty barista at the Coffee Bean on San Vicente Boulevard:
I know there were twenty people behind me in line,
But I was on a cellphone call with my mother.
Didn't you see me hold up my index finger?
That means I'll order my soy decaf hazelnut latte in just a couple of minutes.
So what's with the attitude lady?
No tip for you!

Got a trashcan of Styrofoam peanuts
You can have 'em for free
You can drop by on the weekend
And pick 'em up from me
But the trashcan ain't part of the deal
Only givin' you the peanuts, get real!
Don't have hefty bag, so bring your own,
Don't bug me with questions on the phone
Don't ask for help, don't waste my time
And don't complain 'cause they won't cost you a dime
Just ask yourself:
Do you want my Styrofoam peanuts?
You can have my Styrofoam peanuts.
Do you want my Styrofoam peanuts?
You can have them all.

They're on Craigslist!
Craigslist!  Oh, baby come on!
I'm on Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist!
I'm on Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist now!

Craigslist!
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Al's Brain''' is the name of a 3D movie about the human brain that is being presented from July 10, 2009 to August 9, 2009 at the [http://www.ocfair.com/2009/ Orange County Fair]. It will also feature a never before seen 3D Music Video.

Guest Stars: {{W|Tim &amp; Eric}}, {{W|Tom Lennon}}, {{W|Patton Oswalt}}, and {{W|Paul McCartney}}

==The Exhibit==
You first walk in and enter a room with many hanging signs with optical illusions and brain teasers on them. You grab a pair of orange-rimmed 3D glasses and sit in front of the movie screen.&lt;br /&gt;
Al comes and the screen and does some 3D effects and starts asking trivia about the human brain such as &quot;do we really use only 10% of our brain?&quot; and &quot;Can a person survive with a metal stake driven through his skull?&quot; Then, the show starts. I can't say anymore.

Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
One, two, a-one, two, three, four

Well I, can't go to the park
I can't go to work
I can't do nothin'
I gotta stay in my house like a jerk

How come I always lose
My car has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

You know, can't visit my girlfriend
I can't go to school
I can't go anywhere
Gotta stay in my room like a fool

'Cause I got grease in my hair
My Belvedere's in disrepair
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

So I, went to see my mechanic
He said, &quot;Okay, now what is wrong&quot;
I told him my car wouldn't start
He said, &quot;This shouldn't take very long&quot;

So he replaced all my plugs and my points
And he looked at my carburetor
He took out my engine and turned it around
And then seventeen hours later

He looked at my headlights and said
&quot;Son, how long have these things been on&quot;
I told him, &quot;Oh, about three or four weeks&quot;
He said, &quot;Buddy, I know what's wrong&quot;
&quot;But I hate to be the one to give you the news&quot;
&quot;You got the dead car battery blues&quot;

So now I, can't go to my office
Can't work on my job
I might as well lock myself up in my room
And live my life like a slob

How come I always lose
My Belvedere has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

Hey! I left my sandwich in the backseat!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Got hair galore from every pour
We're scared that it might kill us
Now we want to shave our heads
More often than Bruce Willis

I've got an electric shaver
For all of my back hair
Wanna do me a favor 
If you would you would be so kind and help me reach behind

I find a lot of shaving cream's the slickest way to do it
It makes my back bone tickle and it turns my spinal fluid

I've got an electric shaver
For shavin my back hair
I love my electric shaver
It cuts me real close
It's great for up my nose
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
When I was a little boy
(When I was just a boy)
And my mother would call my name
(When I was just a boy)
She'd say I had to be in the house by seven
(When I was just a boy)

But I'd stay out late at night
(When I was just a boy)
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, I know she'd hit me, she'd hit me
She'd sit me on her knees and whip me

Oh, she'd hit me with a rock
She'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
She'd hit me (hit me with a rock)
She'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)

And when I was grown to be a man
(Grown to be a man)
The minute the boss would call my name
(Grown to be a man)
And say I had to be in the office by seven
(Grown to be a man)

I'm a constipated man
(Grown to be a man)
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, my boss'd hit me, he'd hit me
He'd tie me to a chair and whip me

Oh he'd hit me with a rock
He'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
He'd hit me (hit me with a rock)
He'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)

When I was grown to be President
(Was the President)
The minute the congress'd call my name
(Was the President)
And said some papers had to be signed by Thursday
(Had to be signed by Thursday)

I'd fly away to Pakistan
(Was the President)
And the second that I'd get back home
Oh, I know they'd hit me, they'd hit me
With leather and chains they'd whip me

Oh, they'd hit me with a rock
They'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
They'd hit me. (Hit me with a rock)
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
Hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
Yah yah yah yah yah yah
(Hit me with a rock)
(Hit with a rock)
Ow, whaddaya doin' to me, get away from me
(Hit with a rock, oh baby)
(Hit with a rock)
(He's gettin' hit with a rock)
(He's gettin' hit with a rock, oh baby)
(Hit with a rock)

Wait a minute, hold it
I think he's dead
Let's leave
Let's get out of here, man
&lt;/pre&gt;

I hear those Ice cream bells and I start to drool,
Keep a couple Quarts in my locker at school
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin old,
Vanilla just leaves me cold,
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me,
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon, I know what I need, baby

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with me, OW!

They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same,
The folks at Baskin-Robbins all know my name,
When their supply is gone,
then I'll be movin' on
But I'll be back on Monday afternoon,
You'll see, another truckload's comin' in for me,
All for me, I'm singin'

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love Rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with me, OW!

Oh, make it talk.

When I'm all alone,
I just grab myself a cone,
If i get fat and lose my teeth that's fine with me,
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key, singin',

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love Rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with me.

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love Rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with

I love Rocky Road,
So won't you go and buy a half gallon baby
I love Rocky Road,
So have another triple scoop with me!

&lt;pre&gt;
I had a pizza,
Covered with cheese.
I wrapped it all up in aluminum foil,
Stuck it back in the freeze.
Look at my crust now,
See what I mean.
It's getting all wrinkled,
And my pepperoni is hairy and green.
Ah, 'cause it's moldy now,
It got moldy fast.
How can I
Make leftovers last, make leftovers last?
I was so hungry,
What could I do?
I finished the pizza
And topped it all off with some mystery stew.
Now I feel kinda queasy,
Yeah, yeah, what can I say?
So I called my physician
To wish him that he'd make a house call today.

Woah, 'cause he's my doctor, doctor,
And his name is Bernie, Bernie.
Oh, doctor, doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty dismal.
Doctor, doctor,
And his name is Bernie, Bernie.
Oh, doctor, doctor,
Where's my Pepto Bismol?

The first steak I ordered,
It wasn't very hot.
I had to send it back,
Let 'em have one more shot.
But the second steak I ordered,
Well it was lousy too.
Now I really hate to say it,
But there's one thing that you gotta do.
Make me steak number three, yeah.
Make me steak number three.
Make me steak number three, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Make me steak number three.

Burger King!
What's the price for fries?
I'll take the jumbo size!
I need fast food tonight!

Hey! Oooh! Oh!
One rule you all should obey:
Eat from the four basic food groups everyday.
Have bread, and vegetables too,
Some dairy products, but whatever you do
Don't you forget about meat.
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
Don't you forget about meat.

I know to keep a woman satisfied.
When I whip out my Diner's Card their eyes get so wide.
They're always in the mood for something to munch.
Ah girls, they wanna have lunch.
Ah, girls just wanna have...
That's all they really want,
Some lunch.
Don't ask 'em to dinner
Or breakfast or brunch,
'Cause girls, they wanna have lunch.
Ah, girls just wanna have lunch.
Girls they want, wanna have lunch, girls, wanna have...

Fat and weak, what a disgrace.
Guess the champ got too lazy.
Ain't gonna fly now, he's just takin' up space.
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain.
But he's no bum, he lives down the street.
He bought the neighborhood deli.
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat.
Come inside, maybe you'll hear him say,
Try the rye or the kaiser,
They're on special tonight.
Let me please be your catering advisor.
If you want substitutions,
I won't put up a fight.
You can have your roast beef on the rye or the kaiser.

I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool.
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school.
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin' old,
Vanilla just leaves me cold.
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me!
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon, I know what I need.
Baby, I love rocky road,
So won't you go and buy half a gallon, baby?
I love rocky road,
Now have another triple scoop with me!
Ow!

Oh, oh, here she comes.
Boy, she likes that processed meat.
Oh, oh, here she comes.
She's Spameater!

Baby, when we go to parties,
I drink a buncha beer.
Then my tummy starts a-grumblin'
Feelin' queer.
And then I feel like
I feel like throwin' up!
I feel like throwin' up!
Feel like throwin' up on you.

Avocado,
What makes you think you're so holy?
You're gonna be guacamole before too long.
Oh, you're a green one,
You know that you're out of season.
You'd better let somebody eat you,
Let somebody eat you.
Ya better let somebody eat you
Before it's too late.

Wanna whole lotta lunch!
Wanna whole lotta lunch!
Wanna whole lotta lunch!
Wanna whole lotta lunch!
Way down inside!
Woman, you need
LUNCH!

Goin' to the market now, market now.
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer.
Walkin' down the shopping aisle, shopping aisle,
Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer.
Never gonna stop, eat it up,
Such a tasty snack.
I always eat too much, and throw up,
But I'll soon be back
For my-my-my-y-y woo!
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my-my-my-y-y woo!
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna! 
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Announcer: &quot;Who fixes plumbing problems in a flash? Twenty four hours a day? Seven days a week?&quot;)

Baby, I sure wish I could lend you a hand
But plumbing's one thing I don't understand
It's true (Haven't got a clue)
B-b-b-baby, I can tell you've got a big problem
When I flush the john, then your shower goes on
(Baby) Now watcha gonna do?
If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench
(Baby) He'll be there for you

Shower's backing up (up, up)?
Water won't go down (down, down)?
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Don't forget my plumber
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Sink's been stopped up all summer
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Better call the plumber
He'll know what to do

Pipes been blowing up
Pipes been breaking down
And the carpet's soaked... right through
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba, kitchen's flooded, too
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba, girl, you know it's true

B-b-b-betcha this guy makes more than my lawyer
If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay
(Baby) He can be here by 2:00
So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash
Makin' service calls in his overalls
(Baby) He'll do his best for you

Sewer's backing up (up, up)?
Got you feelin' down (down, down)?
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Don't forget my plumber
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Leaky pipes are a bummer
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Time to call the plumber
Maybe call a few

Got a problem with plumbing?
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the drain it was cloggin', cloggin'
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night
If hairballs, grease and goo
Won't let the water through
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah

When I flush the john, now when I flush the john
It turns your shower on
(Roto-Rooter 6-5000)
Ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Better call my plumber
He'll know what to do

(Announcer: Call now. We're in the yellow pages!)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Risin' above the city, blockin' out the noonday sun, it dwarfs
The mighty redwoods and it towers over everyone

I still remember... when that delivery truck came down our block
What a lucky guy, I hear he got the last one in stock

And the neighbors are just green (and the neighbors (and the neighbors...))
(They say,) &quot;That's the biggest screen we've ever seen!&quot;

(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) It's Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
(Everybody come and see...) Everybody come and see... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)

(Ooh ooh ooh... (Ohhh, ohh, oh oh oh))
There's Frank's remote control, you can look... but don't touch it, please
'Cause Frank's the one in charge and he decides what everybody sees

The picture's crystal clear and everything is magnified
Robert DeNiro's (Robert DeNiro's) mole has got to be ten feet wide

Everybody in the town (everybody (everybody in the town...))
Can hear those 90,000 watts of Dolby sound

And I'm mighty proud to say (and I'm mighty (Yes, I'm mighty proud to say...))
Now I can watch &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from thirty blocks away!

(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) On Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
(Everybody come and see...) Everybody come and see (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) Frank's 2000-inch TV (Frank's 2000-inch TV)
(Everybody come and see...) Everybody come and see (Frank's 2000-inch TV)

I'm gonna get one of my own real soon...
It's like having a drive-in movie in your own living room! Woah...!
Hey now... (Woah...!) hey now na na na now
(Woah...!) Hey now... (Woah...!) hey now na na now

Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
Everybody come and see (Frank's 2000-inch TV!) (You won't believe it!)

(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) It's Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)
(Everybody come and see...) Everybody come and see... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!) (Hey!)

(Frank's 2000-inch TV...) Frank's 2000-inch TV... (Frank's 2000-inch TV!)

Carbon monoxide
Making me choke
No A.C.
And the radio's broke
Cars backed up
Far as you can see
Seems like I've been waiting here for all eternity
Oh, and just in case you're wondering
I'll tell you where I am
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck right here in the middle of this...

Traffic jam
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam
The freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam
My radiator's boiling hot
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam

Trapped inside
My automobile
Cobweb's gowin'
On the steerin' wheel
Now, I'm no genius
But one thing I know
I shouldn't have had that bag of bran muffins
An hour and a half ago
Yeah, and if you need to find me
I'll tell you where I am
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck smack dab in the middle of this...

Traffic jam
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam
The freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam
Well, I thought we were movin' but I guess we're not
'Cause I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam

Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam
yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper...
Yay-hey!

There's a yuppie on a cellular phone
I'm gonna puke if I here any more
There's a motorcycle zoomin' by me
Watch what happens when I open my door
Now we're all goin' nowhere fast
Well, I guess that's perfectly clear
I left home five hours ago
And I can still see my house from here
So if anybody's tryin' to find me
Well, I'll tell you where I am
Right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck right here in the middle of this...

Traffic jam
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam
The freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam
Now my back teeth are floatin' and my nerves are shot
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Stuck right here in the middle of a traffic jam
Traffic Jam... traffic jam... traffic jam... woo!

I slept with Bigfoot, too
Get me on Sally Jesse
Put me on Donahue
'Cause I wanna tell the world about it
Right Now

My dog's a narcoleptic
My mom's a circus freak
I gotta get a spot on
Geraldo's show this week
'Cause I wanna tell the world about it
Right Now

I'm just an anorexic codependent bingo addict
Stripper born without a chin
And I'm only comfortable talking about it
When the whole wide world is listening in

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me

My wife ran off with Elvis
My boss shaved off my hair
I've got a thing for poodles
And rubber underwear
And I wanna tell the world about it
Right Now

I had a close encounter
I never chew my food
I got eleven nose jobs
I yodel in the nude
And I wanna tell the world about it
Right Now

I'm just a cross-dressin' alcoholic neo-Nazi
Porno star, as you may have guessed
And I'm really gonna feel a whole lot better
If you let me get this thing off my chest

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me

I'm just your average schizophrenic nymphomaniac
Albino go-go dancer, you see
Nothin' so bad that I can't share it
With a billion friends on national TV, whoa...

I have no genitalia
I sold my kids for cheese
I love my blow up doll, so
Bring out those cameras, please
'Cause I wanna tell the world about it
Right Now

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me

Talk Soup... Talk Soup
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Since you've been gone
Well, I feel like I've been chewing on tinfoil
Since you've been gone
It's like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil
Oh well, I'm feelin' like I stuck my hand
Inside a blender and turned it on
You know, I've been in a butt load of pain
Since you've been gone

(Since you've been gone)
I couldn't feel any worse if you dropped
A two-ton bowling ball on my toes
(Since you've been gone)
It couldn't hurt any more if you shoved
A red-hot cactus up my nose

Since you've been gone
Well, it feels like I'm getting tetanus shots every day
Since you've been gone
It's like I've got an ice cream headache that won't go away
Ever since that day you left me
I've been so miserable, my dear
I feel almost as bad as I did
When you were still here
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Say, do you remember that guy Larry next door?
Well, he always was the neighborhood clown
Like the time he pulled my pants off and he took those colored pictures
And posted copies all over town
Or the time that he dumped toxic waste on my lawn
Or those wacky prank phone calls from midnight 'till dawn
What a crazy kid Larry was, always foolin' around!

Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try

Say, do you remember when I lost all my hair
'Cause Lar' gave me that Nair shampoo
And hey, how 'bout the day he put Ben Gay inside my jockstrap
And filled my toothpaste tube up with glue
All those wedgies he gave, all those shoestrings he tied
All those brownies he made with the Ex-Lax inside
Oh Lar', I swear, it was a laugh a minute with you!

Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try, oh

You know I couldn't help but laugh
Even though he treated me like slime
Remember when he cut my car in half?
Well, it really got me good that time!

Say, do you remember when I broke in Larry's house
Late at night and tied his mouth with a rag
Then I dragged him by his ankles to the middle of the forest
And stuffed him in a big plastic bag
If the cops ever find him, who knows what they'd say
But I'm sure if old Lar' were still with us today
He would have to agree with me, it was a pretty good gag!

Oh boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try
Oh boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try
No matter how I try...

Oh, you remember Larry?

Oh, you remember Larry?

Oh, you remember Larry?
(.sdnah ruoy no emit eerf fo tol lufwa na evah tsum uoy ,yoB)

Oh, you remember Larry?

Oh, (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) you remember (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) Larry?

Oh, (Larry!) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) you remember (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) Larry?

Oh... (Larry...) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember)

(Larry!) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember)

(Yes, I remember, remember, remember) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember)

(Yes, I remember, remember, remember) (Yes, I remember, remember, remember)

You tell a joke and forget the punchline
Why you always wastin' my time?
Hey baby, trust me, you just disgust me
You hair's a mess and your make-up's crusty
I don't know too many females
Who make a habit of biting their toenails
Woah, every time you call, you drive me up the wall
Honey, just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl
I'm sure we'd be happy together
If only one thing weren't true
Oh baby, I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you

You drink the milk right from the carton
What are you, in kindergarten?
You're belchin' everywhere, foulin' up the air
Then you use my razor to shave your back hair
You don't have an ounce of class
You're just one big pain in the neck
How much more can I take now, give me a break now
You even snore when you're wide awake now
You tell all your friends we're the perfect couple
Well, maybe you should get a clue
'Cause baby, I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Baby, you're so nauseatin'
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you

And when you softly call my name
It's like listenin' to that squeaky chalk sound
And when you look at me that special way
It's hard for me to keep my lunch down
And when you askin' me what I'm thinkin', honey, usually I'm thinkin'
How I'd really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape
So I wouldn't have to listen to you asking me those stupid questions
Over and over again

Well, that disgusting noise you make when you laugh
Gives me a throbbing migraine
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)
Until you came along I never dated anyone
This low on the food chain
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)
You've got inhuman body odor
You've got the hair of a boxing promoter
Yeah, your teeth are all yellow, your butt's made of Jell-O
You woke up in a puddle, droolin' on your pillow
I hate the way you crack your knuckles
I hate your whiny loser girlfriends too
But mostly I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Really now, you're aggravatin'
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Not to mention irritatin'
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Well, now won't you give my best regards to Satan
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you

I'm so sick of you
I'm so sick of you
I'm so sick of you
You make me sick

(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you) I'm so sick of you, now

&lt;pre&gt;
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser, baby
So why don't you kill me (everybody)
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser, baby
So why don't you kill me

Hey

I am I am I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I'm gonna get close to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you, too
Hurt you, too

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know you know, you know, you know

Here I come I come I come I come
Here I come I come I come

‘Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Help me, I broke apart my insides
Help me, I've got no soul to sell
Help me, the only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I wanna ** you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna ** you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

Hey, hey, hey

You bang bang bang bang bang
Blame blame blame
You bang bang bang bang bang
It's not my thing so let it go

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide
No
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died
'Til you died
Well you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You oughta know

Hey

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely, too
When you don't know yourself
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything

Black Hole Sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black Hole Sun
Won't you come, won't you come

Black Hole Sun, Black Hole Sun
Won't you come
Black Hole Sun, Black Hole Sun
Won't you come
Black Hole Sun, Black Hole Sun

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
And am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned
Or am I just stoned

Hey
&lt;/pre&gt;

I will not eat them in the rain

Don't like Green Eggs and Ham

| Al gets fed a spoonful of a yogurt substance. ||

| Two girls start kissing and licking the sides of Al's face ||I would not eat them in the rain I will not eat them on a train
|-
| A man starts wrapping rope around Al's head || I do not like them in a box, I do not like them with a fox, I will not eat them in a house, I do not like them with a mouse
|-
| Two feat start rubbing the sides of Al's face || I do not like Green Eggs and Ham, I do not like them Sam
|-
| A man pokes his head out of the right side of the screen || I am
|-
| In a high voice the man says &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; || Green Eggs and Ham
|-
| Al pushes the man's face away, Al seems unhappy and says &quot;Alright that's enough&quot; || Alright that's enough

&lt;pre&gt;
My whole family
Loves &quot;Three's Company&quot;
See the reruns constantly
There on my TV

Syndicated Incorporated

Well, I know what's on the tube
I know just what too see
Got my TV Guide with me

&quot;MASH&quot; and &quot;All In The Family&quot;
&quot;The Munsters&quot; and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;
I will always be busy
Watching my TV

Oprah Winfrey talks to me
Every day at three
Then soon it'll be
&quot;Wheel&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy&quot;

Syndicated Incorporated
Syndicated Incorporated

Well, I'm in such ecstasy
When I'm watchin' TV
I'm a boob tube devotee

Think I'm losin' my sanity
I'm addicted to Reggis &amp; Kathy Lee
Forever I will always be
Glued to my TV

Love &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;
And &quot;Dynasty&quot;
And &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;
And &quot;Hard Copy&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill
Always has places to go
And people to kill

Danger is the game he plays
And he holds every card
'Cause if you wanna win
You gotta spy hard

A man of the world
So suave and discreet
He trips over the women
Piled up at his feet

But evil's lurking
So he's always on his guard
Cause if your gonna spy
You better spy hard

He's always there
When the chips are beginning to fall
He wouldn't care if they kicked him and grabbed him
And shot him and stabbed him
And nailed both his ears to the wall

Facing death everyday
Is a tough job for any man
But his hours are flexible
And he's got a great dental plan

By the way if you walked in late
Allow me to reiterate
The name of this movie is Spy Hard

They call it Spy Hard
You're watching Spy Hard
It's the theme from Spy Hard
&lt;/pre&gt;

You did a really rotten thing
And let Scout take all the blame
You wrecked his reputation
And left that poor boy in shame
Yeah, but now I think it's time
To show who really did the crime
Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, lyin', worthless hunk of slime

Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, cheatin'
Lyin', no good, lousy, stinkin'
Back stabbin', scum suckin', worthless hunk of slime

&lt;pre&gt;
Aquarius
There's travel in your future when your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus
Fill that void in your pathetic life by playing Whack-A-Mole seventeen hours a day

Pisces
Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos with the Ebola virus
You are the true Lord of the Dance, no matter what those idiots at work say

Aries
The look on your face will be priceless when you find that forty pound watermelon in your colon
Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf, then give a hickey to Meryl Streep

Taurus
You will never find true happiness - what you gonna do, cry about it?
The stars predict tomorrow you'll wake up, do a bunch of stuff, and then go back to sleep

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

Gemini
Your birthday party will be ruined once again by your explosive flatulence
Your love life will run into trouble when your fiance hurls a javelin through your chest

Cancer
The position of Jupiter says you should spend the rest of the week face down in the mud
Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose while taking your driver's test

Leo
Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt and staple it to your boss's face, oh no
Eat a bucket of tuna-flavored pudding, then wash it down with a gallon of strawberry Quik

Virgo
All Virgos are extremely friendly and intelligent - except for you
Expect a big surprise today when you wind up with your head impaled on a stick

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

Now you may find it inconceivable or at the very least a bit unlikely that the relative position of the planets and the stars could have a special deep significance or meaning that exclusively applies to only you, but let me give you my assurance that these forecasts and predictions are all based on solid, scientific, documented evidence, so you would have to be some kind of moron not to reaize that every single one of the is absolutely true.

Where was I?

Libra
A big promotion is just around the corner for someone much more talented that you
Laughter is the very best medicine, remember that when your appendix bursts next week

Scorpio
Get ready for an unexpected trip when you fall screaming from an open window
Work a little harder on improving your low self-esteem, you stupid freak

Sagittarius
All your friends are laughing behind your back (kill them)
Take down all those naked pictures of Ernest Borgnine you've got hanging in your den

Capricorn
The stars say that you're an exciting and wonderful person, but you know they're lying
If I were you, I'd lock my doors and windows and never never never never never leave my house again

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today

That's your horoscope for today (that's your horoscope for today)
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today (yay yay yay yay yay)
That's your horoscope for today
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
Yeah, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want
So tell us what you want, what you really really want
I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want
So tell us what you want, what you really really want
I wanna ha, I wanna ha, I wanna ha, I wanna ha
I wanna really really really wanna zigga zigga ah
If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends (gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give (you've got to give)
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

Hey!

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
And I'm so hot, 'cause I'm in hell
I'm not sick, but I'm not well
And it's a sin (yes it's a sin) to live so well

Ghetto superstar - that is what you are
Coming from afar, reaching for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh huh
From one corner to another, uh huh

Everybody (yeah)
Rock your body (yeah)
Everybody
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, all right
All right

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
But now if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow but if the offer's shun
You might as well be walking on the sun
Might as well be walking on the sun

Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of li-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ight

I wanna push you around, well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down, well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, yeah, well I will

I want something else
To get me through this semi-charmed kinda life, baby baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say good-bye
Doot doot doot doot do do do
Doot doot doot doot do do do
Doot doot doot doot do do do
Do do do do do do

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind
We're all stars now in the dope show
We're all stars now in the dope show

Mmmbop, do floppa do wop
Do be dop ah
Do wap, do zap ah, do
Yeah-ee yeah
Mmmbop, do b'zap ah, do wop
Do be dop ah
Do wop, doom zap ah, do

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction
Mama, this surely is a dream
Yeah, yeah mama, this surely is a dream
Dig it, yeah mama, this surely is

Closing time
One last call for alcohol
So finish your whiskey or beer
Closing time
You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
I know who I wanna take me home
I know who I wanna take me home
I know who I wanna take me home
Take us home

'Cause it's closing time
Yeah it's closing time
We're talkin' 'bout closin' time
It's really closin' time

Hey
&lt;/pre&gt;

*This is Al's first single.
*It was originally recorded in a tiled men's bathroom across from KCPR which is a college raio station only using Weird Al's vocals and Al's accordion.
*The song is talking about Bologna sausage, although referencing to Oscar Meyer's Bologna.
*The original recording is on the compilation album Dr. Demento's Dementia Royale
*The original recording made number 3 on Dr Demento's Funny Twenty-five.
*It was re-recorded for Weird Al's [[Album:&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic|first studio album]]
*There is no official music video, although an early demo was shot showing Al lip-syncing to the song at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the December of 1979. It can be found as an easter egg on the DVD [[The Ultimate Video Collection]]
*The capitol records version is on [[Album:Permanent Record: Al In The Box|Permanent Record.]]

&lt;pre&gt;
When we were young, Bernie's Deli was down the block
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
He made a great liver pâté
(You know he did, you know he did, you know he did)
But if there's one thing in this world that I like better
Than a corned beef on rye

It's Chicken Pot Pie
Chicken Pot Pie

(chorus of chicken-cluck imitations)

Keep your crummy appetizers
Don't want no turnip-flavored fries
Or mustard pizza squares
Sorry but they don't compare!

(chicken-clucks)

(instrumental)

He made a great tuna soufflé
(You know he did, you know he did, you know he did)
But if this fast food-eating world in which we live in
Leaves you hungry and dry

There's Chicken Pot Pie
Chicken Pot Pie

(chicken-clucks, fade out)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I had a pizza
Covered with cheese
I wrapped it all up in aluminum foil
Stuck it back in the freeze

Look at my crust now
See what I mean
It's getting all wrinkled
And my pepperoni is hairy and green

Ah, 'cause it's moldy now
It got moldy fast
How can I
Make leftovers last, make leftovers last

I was so hungry
What could I do
I finished the pizza
And topped it all off with some mystery stew

Now I feel kinda queasy
Yeah, yeah, what can I say
So I called my physician
To wish him that he'd make a house call today
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'd like to do some more songs about buildings and food
This is a song about liver, very high in protein, very good for ya
Hope you like it

I don't know why
You feed me so bad
Think of all the health food
I could've had

You took-a my yogurt
And my whole wheat bread
You give me Ding Dongs
And Twinkies instead

I wanna know
Can you tell me
When is it going to end

Take me to the liver
Push it on my platter
Give me a piece of liver
Oh, drop it on my platter

Scarfin' it down
Scarfin' it down
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Goin' to the market now, market now.
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer.
Walkin' down the shopping aisle, shopping aisle,
Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer.

Never gonna stop, eat it up,
Such a tasty snack.
I always eat too much, and throw up,
But I'll soon be back
For my-my-my-y-y woo!

M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my-my-my-y-y woo!
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna.
M-m-m-my bologna!

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This song is about the {{W|Jungle Cruise}} at {{W|Disneyland}}.
* There actually IS (or WAS) a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blQJwfIlYOY&amp;feature=watch_response Skipper Dan on that ride], and he seems to enjoy his job a heck of a lot more than his song character does.

! Visuals !! Lyrics
|-
| A man wakes up from bed and hits his alarm clock, which reads &quot;6:00&quot; || 
|-
| Walks by a picture of himself acting || I starred in every high school play
|-
| Zooms in on picture, it turns to color and shows him acting. || Blew every drama teacher away
|-
| Shows people clapping then cuts to the man graduating. || Graduated first in my class at Julliard
|-
| Zooms out and the picture becomes black and white again and it turns into a picture hanging on the mans wall. He walks by while brushing his teethe. || Took every acting workshop I could
|-
| The man opens his blinds to reveal the Hollywood sign || And I dreamed of Hollywood
|-
| Toothepaste falls from the mans face next to a  playbill of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; || While I read my Uta Hagen, and studied the Bard
|-
| Zooms into playbill to show him acting again || Picked up parts and paid my dues
And got phenomenal rave reviews
|-
| Shows the man signing autographs || I knew the world was gonna love me, without a doubt
|-
| Shows the man on his bed looking at a poster || I was sure that Tarantino would be calling me on my phone Annie Liebowitz would shoot me for Rolling Stone
|-
| He looks in the mirror || But the years have come and gone and I'm sorry to say That's not the way that it's all worked out
|-
| It fades to him wearing a Jungle Cruise outfit on the cruise boat || I'm a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride Skipper Dan is the name And I'm doing 34 shows every day, and every time it's the same
|-
| Dan points to some hippos as the swim by || Look at those hippos, they're wiggling their ears Just like they've done for the last 50 years Now I'm laughing at my own jokes, but I'm crying inside
|-
| Shows Dan laughing a bit as his smile turns to a frown || 'Cause I'm working on the Jungle Cruise ride
|-
| Shows Dan when he was younger playing {{W|Hamlet}} || Oh the critics they used to say, I was the new Olivier
|-
| Text on screen says &quot;Best Actor&quot; and it shows him getting an award || Thought I'd be the toast of Sundance, or maybe Cannes
|-
| Dan's Jungle Cruise boat floats across the screen || Ah, but don't bother trying to IMDB me, The only place you might possibly see me, Is riding my little boat around Adventureland, It ain't exactly what I planned but
|-
| Shows a fake snake in a tree || I'm a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride Skipper Dan is the name
|-
| Shows shows anamotronic figures of a rhino trying to get explorers who are climbing a tree || I'm a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride Skipper Dan is the name And I'm doing 34 shows every day, and every time it's the same
|-
| &quot;Speed the Plow starring Dan&quot; || I would've killed if I'd been in Speed-the-Plow But what's the difference that's all behind me now
|-
| Dan is &quot;steering&quot; the boat as people get on || 'Cause I'm paying the rent and I'm swallowing my pride And I'm working on the Jungle Cruise ride
|-
| Shows Dan acting in {{W|12 Angry Men}} || I should be there on Broadway, knocking 'em dead in 12 Angry Men
|-
| Dan is at the rhino section again and it fades to multiple different families that he's describing it to || But instead I'm here telling these lame jokes Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again!
|-
| Shows a {{W|Bengal Tiger}} || Bengal tigers can jump over 20 feet...
|-
| Shows an elephant || That's an African Bull-Elephant...
|-
| Shows water || There it is. The backside of water! What have I done with my life?
|-
| Shows Dan's Grandfather with wings, as if he were an angel || I should've listened when my Grandfather said Why don't you major in business instead?
|-
| Dan and Ann, another Tour Guide, have their boats right next to each other. They pretend to shoot themselves in the head. || Now my hopes are vanished and my dreams have all died and I'll probably work forever as a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride
|-
| Shows a tiger and an elephant statue as Dans rides by || Skipper Dan is the name
|-
| Shows some snakes wading back and forth || And I'm doing 34 shows every day, and every time it's the same
|-
| Shows more hippos || Look at those hippos, they're wiggling their ears, somebody shoot me 'cause I'm bored to tears!
|-
| Shows a lady taking a picture of the alligators || Always said I'd be famous, I guess that I lied
|-
| Shows Dan getting his pictures taken with many people as it zooms in on his face || 'Cause I'm working on the Jungle Cruise ride I'm still working on the Jungle Cruise ride!

&lt;pre&gt;It's rotten (rotten, rotten, rotten) 
So rotten here (here, here, here) 
So rotten (rotten, rotten, rotten) (uh) 
Oh 

It was like, the last day before trash day (uh) 
My place was gettin' kinda nas-tay (uh) 
Even though the garbage I knew would reek 
(You know) Thought that I could leave it for one more week 

Then, um, I'm takin' 
Birthday cake 'n' 
(Oh) Chili and greasy old bacon 
Throw it all on top of the mess I been makin' 
Wife's so mad, she starts to shakin' 

Leaky bag, 'n' now that girl is gaggin' 
She's naggin' 
&quot;I need you to get that stuff off the kitchen floor&quot; (uh) 
&quot;Is that too much to ask you for?&quot; (oh) 

But I see no reason why 
Can't let a few more weeks go by (uh uh) 
And now garbage is piled up high 
And buddy, you should see the flies 
I said ... 

There's somethin' rotten here (say what?) 
You better hold your nose, oh 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 
Oh, boy there's a lot in here (a lot) 
And every day it grows 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 
Make ya wanna throw up 

Look at all this garbage I keep generatin' 
(Come on) I sit around all day and watch it biodegradin' 
Bet there's a hundred health codes that I'm violatin' 
Even my dog passed out and needed resuscitatin' 

You won't believe it, take a whiff of that aroma 
Sure to put you in a coma 
It's so messy, can't find my toenail clippers 
It so bad the roaches wearin' slippers 

Warm, (uh) sweaty (uh) clothes piled up in this joint 
Stand up by themselves at this point 
It's so filthy, now baby, I can't lie 
I wipe my feet before I go outside 

I wonder what crawled in here and died 
(You know) Walkin' 'round barefoot, I'd be terrified 
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends 
Like, &quot;Hey, I think them rats gettin' big!&quot; 
Oh 

There's somethin' rotten here (say what?) 
You better hold your nose, oh 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 
Oh, look what we got in here (now what?) 
Let's watch it decompose 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 

Make ya wanna throw up 
With a little bit a (puke noise 2x), and a little bit a (puke noise 2x) 
Make me wanna throw up 
It makes ya wanna (puke noise 2x), just makes ya wanna (puke noise 2x) 
Oh 

Some Lysol, some Comet 
I got a mop and it's got your name on it 
(What?) I'm just kiddin', doggone it 
(Oh) Unless you gonna do it 

Careful not to (eh?) breathe the fumes 
Check it, garbage piles are goin' all the way to the bathroom 
Turn into toxic waste sometime this afternoon 
Better get a Hazmat suit and a push broom 
Oh 

There's somethin' rotten here (say what?) 
You better hold your nose, oh 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 
Oh, it's gone to pot in here (to pot) 
Bring out the firehose, oh 
(Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out) (uh uh uh uh) 

Make ya wanna throw up 
With a little bit a (puke noise 2x), and a little bit a (puke noise 2x) 
Make me wanna throw up 
Give a little bit a (puke noise 2x), and a tiny bit a (puke noise 2x) 

Make ya wanna throw up 
Mix a little bit a (puke noise 2x)with a molecule a (puke noise 2x) 
Make me wanna throw up 
It makes me wanna (puke noise 2x) (aw, eww), just makes me wanna (puke noise 2x) [hock] [spit]
Oh

==Trivia==
* The song is about {{W|Charles Nelson Reilly}} panelist on the {{W|Match Game}} television show.
* The music video is animated by [[Jib-Jab]], the animators who did the video for Al's [[Do I Creep You Out]]. The music video also leaves out a whole verse, making it 40 seconds shorter.
* This is the first music video of Al's where you can insert your own face.
* On Weird Al's Twitter (alyankovic) he has posted pictures with green screen caps and things, those were in the making of this video. [http://www.twitpic.com/user/alyankovic Twitpic]
* CNR ripping the man's heart may be based upon a scene from Indiana Jones &amp; the Temple of Doom.
* CNR's trophy room has the head of Chuck Norris, which may be a reference to the [http://chucknorrisfacts.com/ Chuck Norris Facts].
* The line, &quot;'Cause you can spit in the wind or tug on Superman's cape, But Lord knows you just don't mess around with CNR,&quot; is a reference to the {{W|Jim Croce}} song, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Don%27t_Mess_Around_with_Jim%7C &quot;You Don't Mess Around With Jim]].&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
So you got dry rot and your water pressure's weak
Your trash compactor's broke, the roof has sprung a leak
You just found out your toilet's overflowed
And your smoke detector's smoking and your heater's gonna explode
But

I'll repair for you (when the roof starts to fall)
I'll repair for you (all the cracks in your wall)
I'll repair for you (every nail, bolt and screw)

Your washer's busted and your faucet drips all night
You got some termites with a healthy appetite
Well have no fear, I'll patch up every hole
And I'm licensed and I'm bonded, even se habla espanol
So

I'll repair for you (when your doorknob is loose)
I'll repair for you (when your plunger's no use)
I'll repair for you (with a caulk and hot glue)

I am prepared to tackle all kinds of paste and Spackle
You got a leaky shower, I'll be there in an hour
With stucco, bricks and plaster, I am a Jedi master
We'll help you through your crisis
Check out our low, low prices too, yeah

Your floors are sagging and your plumbing's shot
But if you don't mind my hairy butt crack every time that I squat

I'll repair for you, anything that you need
I'll repair for you, and my word's guaranteed
I'll repair for you, I'll rewire it too
I'll repair for you
I'll repair for you
I'll repair for you, every nail, bolt and screw
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
This is a new composition which features
A random assortment of all living creatures
You'll find that it's not quite exactly the same
As the one by Camille Saint what's-his-name

Camille, in his research, was slightly behind
And I guess that some critters just plain slipped his mind


So to fill in this void in the Animal Kingdom
I'll read some new verses. I'm not gonna sing them

So kindly shut up and I'll narrate for you
Carnival of the Animals part two
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Charles Nelson Reilly was a mighty man
The kind of man you'd never disrespect
He stood 8 foot tall, wore glasses 
And he had a third nipple on the back of his neck
He ate his own weight in coal 
And excreted diamonds every day
He could throw you down a flight of stairs 
But you still would love him anyway
Yeah, you know you'd love him anyway

Charles Nelson Reilly won the Tour de France
With two flat tires and a missin' chain
He trained a rattlesnake to do his laundry
I'm tellin' you the man was insane
He could rip out your beatin' heart
And show it to you right before you died
Every day he'd make the host of Match Game 
Give him a piggyback ride
Yeah, a two-hour piggyback ride
Giddyup, Gene!

Ninja warrior, master of disguise
He could melt your brain with his laser beam eyes
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
He had his very own line at the DMV
He made sweet, sweet love to a manatee
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, that was somethin' to see, I tell ya

Charles Nelson Reilly sold his toenail clippings 
As a potent aphrodisiac
He ran a four minute mile blindfolded 
With an engine block strapped to his back
He could eat more frozen waffles 
Than any other man I know
Once he fell off the Chrysler building 
And he barely even stubbed his toe
Had a tiny little scratch on his toe
Didn't even hurt

Charles Nelson Reilly figured out cold fusion 
But he never ever told a soul
I've seen the man unhinge his jaw 
And swallow a Volkswagen whole
He'd bash your face in with a shovel 
If you didn't treat him like a star
'Cause you can spit in the wind or tug on Superman's cape
But Lord knows you just don't mess around with CNR
No no no
Talkin' bout CNR
Ohh
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you're an ant then he's likely to eat ya
Although his long nose makes him look rather hideous
He's still listed first in the &quot;encyclopedius&quot;

Deep inside the murky swamp there lives the alligator
His policy is first to chomp and then ask questions later
Although his lifestyle may seem crass, I really wouldn't knock it
He'd never wear a shirt that has a yuppie on the pocket

&lt;pre&gt;
The amoeba is so small you need a microscope to see one
It hurts the eyes, but I'll concede, I'd rather see then be one
They never sing or laugh or talk or eat fondue or quiche
And if you take one for a walk you need a tiny leash
I know the thing must have a brain although I couldn't tell you where
It sure must be an awful pain to be so unicellular

&lt;pre&gt;
We're dangerous dudes, we got bad attitudes
Most of our brain cells are gone
We were born to be bad, you better not get us mad
Or we just might toilet paper your lawn
We got a reputation 'round these parts
We only leave a ten percent tip
Sometimes we don't return our shopping carts
Stay out of our way and don't you give us no lip

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly
That's what we are
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly

We wear black leather in the hottest weather
You can't imagine the smell
We got three-day stubble, our names spell trouble
T-R-U-B-E-L
Reaisin' hell, bendin' the rules just a little
We're livin' only for thrills
We squeeze our toothpaste tubes from the middle
And wait until the last minute to pay our telephone bills

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly
You better believe it
We're young... young, dumb and ugly
I'll tell you again
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly
We're comin' to your town
Yeah, we're young... young, dumb and ugly

We're wild, reckless men, we're on a rampage again
We drive with just one hand on the wheel
Danger's in our soul, we're goin' out of control
Swimmin' right after a big heavy meal
We're there wherever trouble's starting
We're rebels without a clue
We drink milk right from the carton
And keep our library books 'till they're way overdue

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly
That's what we are
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly
You can't stop us
We're young... we're so young, dumb and ugly
Young, dumb &amp; ugly
We're young... we're young, dumb and ugly
So ugly
Young... dumb... &amp; ugly
&lt;/pre&gt;

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat
A million people every day are starving in the street

Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four
There's garbage in the water
There's poison in the sky
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

Well, what's the matter little friend, you think this party is the pits
Enjoy it while you can because we'll soon be blown to bits
The monkeys in the Pentagon are gonna cook our goose
Their finger's on the button, all they need is an excuse

It doesn't take a military genius to see
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide
When they drop the big one, we all get fried

(Come on boys and girls, sing along, OK?)

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
wow! (background screaming, sound effect)

Well there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed

I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
wow!

Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

(Happy Birthday!)

And a pinch to grow an inch!
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
Everywhere, I see them there, I stop and stare at patterns.
I don't care, I must declare, I got a flair for patterns.
On my hair, the clothes I wear, my savoir faire is patterns.
All I see are patterns, the patterns that repeat!

Let's go into the bathroom...

I know were in a room where you would not expect much math,
Usually you're in here for a shower or a bath,
But if you gaze upon the floor and if you're kind of smart,
You'll see the repetition is like geometric art!

Wow! Haha! Look!

Everywhere, I see them there, I stop and stare at patterns.
I don't care, I must declare, I got a flair for patterns.
On my hair, the clothes I wear, my savoir faire is patterns.
All I see are patterns, the patterns that repeat!

Hey!

A polka-meister like myself never has to be bored,
I just grab my act and play some patterns on my keyboard.
Now's the time for earplugs if you care about your health,
So stand back everybody, I'm going to express myself!

Look at that! Patterns!
I've got blisters on my fingers!
Woo! Hey!
Oh get down!
Yeah!
Help me somebody!
Still there?
Okay.

Next time you find yourself at an exciting polka party,
You can make some patterns with your feet and with your body,
If you don't know the steps yet, here's the gang with all the answers,
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the `Weird Al' Polka Dancers!

There they are.

Everywhere, we see them there, we stop and stare at patterns.
We don't care, we must declare, we've got a flair for patterns.
On our hair, the clothes we wear, our savoir faire is patterns.
All we see are patterns, the patterns that repeat!

Wallpaper, skyscrapers, funny papers, patterns!
Evergreens, nouvelle cuisine, human beings, patterns!
Garden rakes, wedding cakes, rattlesnakes, patterns!
Golden wheat, little feet, my heartbeat...
I gotta stop...
Patterns! Patterns! Patterns! Patterns!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Once, not very long ago, I was respected, I was popular (popular, ooh)
But now I hang my head in shame (ahh, ooh)
My life is filled with such regret
A bad mistake I can't forget
And now I'll never be the same

Ringtone
Why did I buy this stupid ringtone?
I just can't imagine now what I was thinking at all (What was I thinking?)
My friends all stare at me whenever I get a call
Well, everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the world really hates my ringtone

When my phone goes off at work
I look like the biggest jerk
Total strangers wanna slap me around
When it's ringin' on the terrace
My neighbors get embarrassed
They're beggin' me to move outta town
Well, it made my wife so sick
She smashed my iPhone with a brick
But I had it fixed, and now it's just fine
It's a pain, I sure don't need it
And I probably should delete it
But for me that would be crossin' the line
'Cause I hate to waste a buck ninety nine
Hey, I paid good money for this...

Ringtone
Why did I buy this stupid ringtone?
I just can't imagine now what I was thinking at all (Really, what was I thinking?)
My friends all stare at me whenever I get a call
Well, everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the world really hates my ringtone

Ringtone
Ringtone
Ahh, ooh

Chinese factory workers (they hate my ringtone)
Muslim women in burqas (really hate my ringtone)
Starvin' kids in Angola (they hate my ringtone)
Even folks with Ebola (just hate my ringtone)
All the nuns and nannies (all the welfare mothers)
All the Pakistanis (all the Wayans brothers)
Everyone on the land, everyone on the sea
Every single person everywhere unanimously
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the whole wide world really hates my
Ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
We've been together for so very long
But now things are changing, oh I wonder what's wrong?
Seems you don't want me around
The passion is gone and the flame's died down

I guess I lost a little bit of self-esteem
That time that you made it with the whole hockey team
You used to think I was nice
Now you tell all your friends that I'm the Antichrist

Oh, why did you disconnect the brakes on my car?
That kind of thing is hard to ignore
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore

I knew that we were having problems when
You put those piranhas in my bathtub again
You're still the light of my life
Oh darling, I'm beggin', won't you put down that knife?

You know, I even think it's kinda cute the way
You poison my coffee just a little each day
I still remember the way that you laughed
When you pushed me down the elevator shaft

Oh, if you don't mind me asking, what's this poisonous cobra
Doing in my underwear drawer?
Sometimes I get to thinkin' you don't love me any more

You slammed my face down on the barbecue grill
Now my scars are all healing, but my heart never will
You set my house on fire
You pulled out my chest hairs with an old pair of pliers

Oh, you think I'm ugly and you say I'm cheap
You shaved off my eyebrows while I was asleep
You drilled a hole in my head
Then you dumped me in a drainage ditch and left me for dead

Oh, you know this really isn't like you at all
You never acted this way before
Honey, something tells me you don't love me anymore, oh no no
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore
&lt;/pre&gt;

I love to watch the Hummingbirds just hovering for hours
They look like mini helicopters pollinating flowers
And yet I still feel sorry for the little Hummingbirds
They always have to hum because they never learned the words

They don't care for salt and they leave icky trails
It's pretty darn hard to tell one from the utter
And French people like them with garlic and butter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="542">Al was going to be getting a show on {{W|Cartoon Network}}. Instead, they decided to make it into a movie. Cartoon Network eventually decided to cancel the whole thing. Al planned to send the script to another company and release the movie, but the idea has since been scrapped.

&lt;pre&gt;
When I said that I'd be faithful
When I promised I'd be true
When I swore that I could never
Be with anyone but you
When I told you that I loved you
With those tender words I spoke
I was only kidding
Now, can't you take a joke?

When I said that I need you, baby
When I told you that I really care
When I said that I can't live without you
When I said I'd follow you anywhere
When I said you could always trust me
When I said I'd never leave you flat
Well, guess what? I was only kidding, baby
I can't believe you fell for that
You're so gullible

(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) You thought that was for real?
I was only kidding
Now I'm sorry if you misunderstood, but the fact remains
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Baby, baby, I was
(I was) only kidding
Well, I guess I got you pretty good
Now listen

When I said that I love you, baby
From the very bottom of my heart
When I said that I miss you so badly
Every second that we're apart
When I swore that you're just getting more and more
Beautiful every day
Well, I was only kidding, honey
What's the matter with you anyway?
Let me tell you something

(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) You understand, don't ya?
I was only kidding
Well, I guess it probably hurt you a lot, but you gotta know
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Come on now, get a clue
I was only kidding
I really love you
NOT!

When I said you oughta marry me
When I said that we should settle down
Well, I was pullin' your leg there, honey
I was just foolin' around! You see, I
I never meant to upset you, darlin'
I never meant to hurt anyone
I was only kidding, baby
Why don't you just put down that gun?
Let's talk this over

(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Watch where you point that thing
(I was only kidding)
Hey, I'm sorry if your heart is broke; you gotta realize
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Aww, yeah
I was only kidding
Now honey, can't you take a joke?
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I didn't lie to you
I was only kidding
Yes indeed
(I was only kidding) Baby, baby, you know
(I was only kidding) Hey!

==Trivia==
*This was the version sung live in 1983 concerts before it was greatly changed for the album [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D]] and for all concerts afterwords.
*There is only one known concert where it was recorded at, namely the 7/29/1983 one at Bottom Line, New York.

==Trivia==
*This song is usually considered to be Al's rarest song. Very little is known about it.
*The only confirmed time it has ever been played live was the second show on June 12, 1981, at Knott's Berry Farm.
*According to unconfirmed reports, the chorus speeds up, and the last line of it is &quot;I'm gonna get me a hustler and a six pack of beer, and have a little orgy on my own.&quot;
*A keyboard version of this song was submitted to Dr. Demento, but never aired.
*This song is very unlike Al.

==Video==
On August 15th, 2006, Al announced that he planned to shoot a music video on the new album around L.A. on August 21st-27th {lucky number 27!!}. He posted a solicitation for volunteers to appear in the video on his MySpace blog. It was later revealed that the video was filmed for &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;. This video was going to be released Monday September 18 at 9 PM Pacific Time on AOL.com, but, since the video had been leaked, AOL cancelled the premiere event and uploaded the video early.

On October 13, 2006 Yankovic teamed up with Yahoo! Music to create a fan-made music video for &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;. The music video, with submissions from fans, is available at http://music.yahoo.com/vid-36680429-White-&amp;-Nerdy-(Fans-Only-Version).</text>

(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
woah wo-ohohohohohh oh
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read-a mah polka face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read ah my polka face
(She's got to love nobody)
Puhpuhpuhpuhpolka face puhpuhpolka face
(Mum mum mum mah)
puhpuhpuhpuhpolka face puhpuhpolka face

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are are-are
Boy don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are are-are

You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothing but a
Womanizer

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

And I was like baby baby baby
baby baby baby
baby baby baby
I thought you'd always be mine

So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what, I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what, I am a rock star
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it, the taste of her cherry chap-stick
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it!

And I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, got you in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay,
stuck on replay
stuck on replay
replay
replay
replay-ay-ay-ay

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Baby are you down?

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break your heart


Don't stop 
make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
tonight
I'm a fight
til we see the sun light
tik tok
on the clock
but the polka don't stop 
(No!)
yodayodaladyhoo yodayodaladyhoo

Puhpuhpuhpolka face puhpuhpolka face
(Mum mum mum mah)
puhpuhpuhpolka face puhpuhpolka face
Oh no you can't read my puhpuhpolka face, talkin' 'bout my face puhphpolka face
puhpuhpuhpolkaface

 &lt;pre&gt;
I've never been
Your average therapist
Not very good
With women or men
But on the farm
I help the animals

The call came in
At a quarter after two
The herd's gone nuts
We don't know what to do
Each one of these
Cows are crazy
And you're our only hope now

This is what they called me for
But I am havin' some doubt
That I can help these cows
I'm the only one they've got now
Will try every Freudian technique out
To try to help these cows!

They won't stand still,
Respect they do not show
Just an udder day,
Using everything I know
Try to pick their brains
They won't respond to me
Seems they're too slow,
For advanced psychology

This is what they called me for
But they've got me wondering how
That I can help these cows?
Trying every trick in the book now
Well I'll do almost anything
Just to help these cows

Every cow just needs to calm down
Every cow needs to be drugged, to be drugged!

Gather all the cows around
Cause I've got the solution now
I can help these, I can help these cows!

This is what I came here for
Get my prescription pad out now
So I can help these cows
Each one of them gets a pill
Wellbutrin should make them chill
I'm going to drug these cows

This is what they called me for
And everyone can sleep better now
Since I've helped these cows
Smarter than I've ever been
Never been afraid of selling out
Just to help the cows

This why I come around
No one can question me now
Because I helped them
Yes I cured those cows.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Had ourselves a little barbeque
Corn on the cob and mashed potatoes too
Joe got the Fritos, Ernie got the stew
So what did you bring

We got the beef
We got the beef
We got the beef
Yeah, we got it

(We got the beef)
Now, everybody get on your feet (we got the beef)
Got a hunk of your favorite meat (we got the beef)
Chuck daddy (we got the beef)
Now, ground round by the pound

We got the beef (we got the beef)
We got the beef (we got the beef, we got the beef)
We got the beef (we got the beef, we got the)
We got the beef

The first steak I ordered,
It wasn't very hot.
I had to send it back,
Let 'em have one more shot.
But the second steak I ordered,
Well it was lousy too.
Now I really hate to say it,
But there's one thing that you gotta do.

Make me steak number three, yeah.
Make me steak number three.
Make me steak number three, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Make me steak number three.

Hey! Oooh! Oh!
One rule you all should obey:
Eat from the four basic food groups everyday.
Have bread, and vegetables too,
Some dairy products, but whatever you do

Don't you forget about meat.
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
Don't you forget about meat.

Down on the street they got bagels
And there's a sale on cream cheese and lox
Nosh on some blintzes and bratwurst
Not in the mood for Jack-In-The-Box

Oy vey

We gonna schlepp on through to Flatbush Avenue
Kielbasa and chopped liver
We gonna schlepp on through to Flatbush Avenue
Or maybe they'll deliver
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I woke up this morning

I was driving around town the other night
And I got the munchies
So I took a walk to Wendle's doughnuts
To get myself something to eat
And I stopped the car
And I opened the door
I got out of my car
I closed the door
I walked over to the lady's window
She said yeah? What do you want?
I said you got any cinnamon doughnuts?
She said no we're out of cinnamon doughnuts
I said you got any jelly-filled doughnuts?
She said no we're out out jelly-filled doughnuts
I said you got any bear claws?
She said oh, wait a minute I'll go check

No, we're out of bear claws
I said well in that case
Baby, do you have any buffalo cookies
She stared me straight in the eye
And said How many do you want?
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This song is almost identical to part of the song [[Albuquerque|Albuquerque.]]
* One recording of this song substitutes &quot;Campus Donuts&quot; for &quot;Wendell's Donuts.&quot; Campus Donuts was an actual donut shop in San Luis Obispo which closed in the late 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9573">This is an archive

== Sup? ==

Hey, The thing! Thanks for making me a sysop. I shall use my powers for good and for awesome. Speaking of, do you have an IRC chat client? If so, meet me in #WeirdAlWiki. Thanks again, [[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] 00:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

== Custom namespaces ==

Hey, The thing. Check out [[Wikicities:Help:Custom namespaces]]. Do we want to make &quot;Song:&quot; and &quot;Album:&quot; custom namespaces? If so, I recommend that you, as owner of the wiki, request those. --[[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] 14:37, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
:Maybe make a &quot;Lyrics:&quot; custom namespace too. How's that coming along? --{{User:Smileyface11945/sig}} 01:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC) t

== question ==

How many users are there? {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 03:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
:Check out [[Special:activeusers]], Bluebry. --[[User:Smileyface11945|Smileyface11945]] 22:08, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
::Ah thanks. Also, no offense, but there are a lot of red links. Ima make pages for these things. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 23:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Rules ==

I'm used to HRWiki. What are the different rules. Example: Guestbooks allowed. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 03:33, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== sysops ==

Because you created this wiki, you should be a sysop. How do people become sysops? [[User:The 386|The 386]]
:He is a sysop. The second a user creats a ne wiki he or she is given complete control and full user titles (i.e.: Admin+sysop+bureaucrat+developer). [[User:E.L. Cool|E.L. Cool]] 04:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
== hi ==
Hi dere the thing. Nice wiki ya got here. [[User:Bubsty|Bubsty]] 04:02, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
:Woah woah Bubsty, I thought you werent going online or something. --[[User:Dantheburgerking|Dantheburgerking]] 04:07, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
::Only on the HR Wiki. Anyway, I'm sorry I can't help this wiki out much. I honestly hardly know anything about Weird Al, other then he's a famous singer and he has awesome hair. But really, this is an AWESOME wiki. After exploring it, I realize that it's... huge. Great job! [[User:Bubsty|Bubsty]] 06:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
:::Thanks. [[User:69.205.189.198|69.205.189.198]] 21:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Moving the site? ==

Hi there. I just came across this place since it was posted at the Weird Al forum. Anyway, I help run a website at the moment and if it's okay with the owner of the space (who is also a big Al fan) we could move this wiki to there. It'd have no ads and would be a lot easier to search, but it would still be using the same software as this wiki and Wikipedia. If you're interested just post a message on my talk page. 

And just in case anyone else is planning to ask for some space, this offer is '''strictly''' limited to the Weird Al Wiki.

BTW, one other thing. I notice you've uploaded a picture from weirdal.com. Sorry to say it, but Bermuda really doesn't like that. It'd be best if you removed it.--[[User:Mewrio|Mewrio]] 07:09, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

== Video ==

Umm, should we add video info? {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 16:34, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:Yes. --{{User:The thing/sig}} 16:38, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
::Like, visuals? 'Cause if yes...
&lt;big&gt;I CALL SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA!!!&lt;/big&gt; {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 16:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:::OK Yea. --{{User:The thing/sig}} 16:43, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
::::So, like, [[Visuals:Smells Like Nirvana]]? Is that how to do it? {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 16:45, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:::::Lemme try to make a template to help out... {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 16:47, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
::::::Hey, um, I can't edit the Inputboxes page, so, will you add a Visuals section onto it? {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 17:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:::::::Thank you. I'm working on it (Smells like Nirvana). {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 17:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== So sorry ==

I am so sorry, but, I'm giving up on Smells Like Nirvana Visuals. I had almost finished it, when the system went down. I had to reinstall the OS - I just can't do it. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 22:51, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:Actually, I'm doin' the It's All About the Pentiums Visuals now. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 23:32, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Bot ==

I noticed there are periods of time when no one is here. We need a bot to protect the wiki while we're gone. Just saying. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 04:02, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== New template ==

I made a template for incoplete articles. Check [[Template:INC|it]] out! {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 04:26, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Gump Visuals ==

Hey. Um, maybe we should follow what I did on [[Visuals:It's All About The Pentiums]] to [[Visuals:Gump]], because, on Gump, if you change the font size, like my compy did when I had to reinstall the OS, it looks different. Like, mine says:''Guitar comes in front of picture.'' by ''Waiting for the bus with his hands''. Just an idea. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 20:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Protection ==

Hi, I've unprotected [[Inputboxes]] and the [[Main Page]].  There really is no need for protection at this stage.  You'll encourage more users by having things as open as possible. Regards -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 15:36, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

:Yes there is. It is '''''THE MOST''''' important thing to a wiki (main page) and if Inputboxes screws up, we may get a page screwed up also. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 01:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::I understand what ou are saying, but in a young wiki the most important thing is finding and keeping new contributors.  Once you have some more growth, you may get more problem edits on the main page and may need to lock it.  But for now, I strongly suggest that it is left open to edits.  It's worth the risk of some vandalism for the benefit of being fully editable.  Remember - everything can be fixed! -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 09:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

:::There are lots of people watching this wiki for vandalism, so you don't need to worry about that. Please read the [[Wikicities:Protection|Wikicities protection policy]] and [[Wikicities:Help:Main Page#Protection of the Main Page considered harmful|Protection of the Main Page considered harmful]]. [[User:Angela|Angela]] ([[Wikicities:User talk:Angela|talk]]) 09:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::::I'm unprotecting this one more time -- really, people are watching for vandalism! And  whatever there is can be easily fixed. It's better for a smaller wiki to leave it open; most people are only going to add useful things to it. [[User:Mindspillage|Mindspillage]] 21:41, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

== HRWiki IRC ==
Yes. Bluebry's the name. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 01:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
:I'm on it now. I'm The-thing. --{{User:The thing/sig}} 01:17, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
::K. I can't go on though. SOrry, compy's screwed up (luck to have Firefox working). Lemme see what I can do. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 01:18, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

==[[mozcom:User Talk:LouCypher#My wiki|Search plugin]]==
Here you go, [http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=weirdal&amp;submitform=Search here] or [http://zoolcar9.lhukie.net/mozilla/searchplugins/weirdalwiki.html here] --[[mozcom:User:LouCypher|LouCypher]] [[mozcom:User_talk:LouCypher|&amp;#9742;]] 20:42, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Babel ==

Hey, um, should we finish [[Weird Al Wiki:Babel|this page]] or delort it? The content is just '''''...'''''. I think finish it. {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 02:09, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

==Trollbrother2 = Me?==
:&lt;s&gt;Hey there The Thing. Uh... bad news.&lt;/s&gt;

:&lt;s&gt;''Your user name or IP address has been blocked by The thing.''&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;''The reason given is this:
Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by &quot;Trollbrother2&quot;. The reason given for Trollbrother2's block is: &quot;Troll everyone agreed.&quot;
You may contact The thing or one of the other administrators to discuss the block. Note that you may not use the &quot;email this user&quot; feature unless you have a valid email address registered in your user preferences. Your IP address is 24.18.208.18. Please include this address in any queries you make.''&lt;/s&gt;

::&lt;s&gt;I have absolutely no clue as to whats going on, but apparently somehow Trollbrother2 and my IP are the same... for some reason. (2nd time). Therefore, I can't edit the hrwooky as long as he's blocked.&lt;/s&gt;
:::&lt;s&gt;So, if you could just... tell the hrwooky guys what happened, and we can try to figure this whole thing out, that would be awesome.&lt;/s&gt;
:&lt;s&gt;Thanks! [[User:Bubsty|Bubsty]] 03:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:::Never mind; it's fixed now. {{User:Bubsty/sig}} 19:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

== DVD Screenshots ==

Hey, La cosa. I was tryin' to take a screenshot of a DVD for the wiki, but when I pasted it, it was like the player. I actually watched Dare to Be Stupid in Paint! Ummm, can you help, and, if you can't, know anyone who could help? {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 19:17, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

== Blocking ==

HOW DARE YOU BLOCK ME!!! I'm just kidding. A misunderstanding! {{User:Bluebry muffin/sig}} 22:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

== Help with Categories ==

Hi, thanks for the welcome! I hope to help out with the Weird Al wiki as much as I can. I just have a question: I have another wiki set up for a different subject and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to put pages in categories. I've looked at the help pages and it just doesn't work. What is the proper coding necessary to automatically have a page in the &quot;Articles for (category)&quot;? Thanks!</text>

&lt;pre&gt;
 1! 2! 3! 4!
 
 So many nights I sit by my window
 Waiting for someone to sing me a song
 So many dreams I kept inside me
 Alone in the dark but now you've come along
 
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You give me hope
 To carry on
 You light up my days
 and fill my nights with song
 
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 
 Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
 Could it be finally I'm turning for home
 Finally, a chance to say HEY! I love you
 Never again to be all alone
 
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You give me hope
 to carry on
 You light up my days
 And fill my nights with song
 
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 (Here we go!) You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 You light up my life
 
 It can't be wrong
 When it feels so right
 'Cause you
 You light up my life
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
We’ve played halls and pavilions
House of Blues and Cotilions
We sang in the sun
And out on the street
Southwest to New England
Australia and New Zealand
Although we’ve seen them
The picture’s not complete
We’d love to play in the Aloha State
That’s one place we can’t wait to see
We’ve played all over and it’s really been great
But up till now we’ve never played in Hawaii
We’ve played Hobart and Hershey
Hallandale and Hadley
We’ve played Hollywood
And Hillsboro too
Hyannis and Hartford
Halifax and Hamburg
Even in New Hampshire
But there’s still something left to do
We’d love to play in the Aloha State
That’s one thing on which we all agree
It’s just a short hop from the Golden Gate
Over the ocean and off, to where we can see
All of the palm trees swayin’
In tropical breezes on white sandy beaches
The start of our Hawaiian fantasy
We’ve been treated like big stars
Rode around in some big cars
We’ve no reason to be cryin’ the blues
We got all that we asked for
Not looking for much more
Maybe on the next tour
That would be good news
If we could play in the Aloha State
That’s one place we can’t wait to see
We’ve played all over and it’s really been great
But up till now we’ve never played in Hawaii
Over the ocean and off, to where we can see
All of the palm trees swayin’
In tropical breezes on white sandy beaches
And colorful fish in the sea
We could be playin’ while hula girls sway
And it would be, the way we always dreamed it
Beautiful blue skies, we’d be in paradise
There in our Hawaiian fantasy
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;I met him in a swamp down in Dagoba,
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda.
S-O-D-A, soda.
I saw the little runt sitting there on a log.
I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, &quot;Yoda.&quot;
Y-O-D-A, Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a Muppet, but he's wrinkled and green.
Oh, my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand.
Oh, my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Well, I left home just a week before,
And I've never ever been a Jedi before.
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course.
He said, &quot;Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force!&quot;

Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben,
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
With my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

So I used the Force.
I picked up a box.
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head.
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said.

He said,&quot;Luke, stay away from the darker side,
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide.&quot;
Oh, my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
&quot;I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed,
But remember, if you kill him then you'll be unemployed.&quot;
Oh, my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess,
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess.
But I know that I'll be coming back some day.
I'll be palying this part till I'm old and gray.
The long-term contract that I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time,
With my Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

Yoda. Yo Yo Yo yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
Yoda. Yo Yo Yo yo Yoda. Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Pigeons are such reprehensible things
Some critics, I'm told, call them rodents with wings
They terrorize folks with their constant dive-bombing
Which some find distasteful and some quite alarming

But still they fulfill an invaluable need
They give old men on park benches something to feed
In return for this honor, all they ask is that you
Allow them to soil the occasional statue
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* It was originally thought that {{W|Lady Gaga}} had denied Al permission of releasing the song, however her manager made the decision and she had never heard it. Things were cleared up and she approved of the song. [http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ Read more here].
* All proceeds of the song and music video will go to the {{W|Human Rights Campaign}}.
* The music video features Al's face on top of a woman's usually scantily clad body to give the illusion that Al is actually wearing the outfits. This trick was done through CGI.
* The music video received a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1992">Lyrics:
&lt;pre&gt;
My mama told me when I was hatched
Act like a superstar
Save your allowance, buy a bubble dress
And someday you will go far
Now on red carpets, well, I'm hard to miss
The press follows everywhere I go
I'll poke your eye out with a dress like this
Back off and enjoy the show!

I'm sure my critics will say it's a grotesque display
Well, they can bite me, baby -- I perform this way
I might be wearin' Swiss cheese or maybe covered with bees
It doesn't mean I'm crazy -- I perform this way

Ooo, my little monsters pay... lots 'cause I perform this way
Baby, I perform this way
Ooo, don't worry, I'm okay... hey, I just perform this way
I'm not crazy, I perform this way

I'll be a troll or evil queen
I'll be a human jelly bean
'Cause every day is Halloween
For me...

I'm so completely original
My new look is all the rage
I'll wrap my small intestines 'round my neck
And set fire to myself on stage
I'll wear a porcupine on my head
On a W-H-I-M
And for no reason now I'll sing in French
Excusez-moi, Qui a pété? (Who cut the cheese?)

Got my straight jacket today, it's made of gold lamé
No, not because I'm crazy - I perform this way
I strap prime rib to my feet, cover myself with raw meat
I'll bet you've never seen a skirt steak worn this way

Don't be offended when you see
My latest pop monstrosity
I'm strange, weird, shocking, odd, bizarre
I'm Frankenstein, I'm Avatar
There's nothing too embarrassing
I'll honestly do anything
But wear white after Labor Day
'Cause baby, I perform this way

Hope you won't think it's cliché if I go nude today
Don't call the cops now, baby, I perform this way
No reason I should regret all the attention I get
I'm not completely crazy, I perform this way, yeah

I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey
I'm always deviating from the norm this way-hey
I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey
I'm really not insane -- I just perform this way-hey
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Pedal to the metal, hope I don't run out of luck
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

My diesel rig is northward bound
It's time to put that hammer down
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel
While I'm waiting for my nails to dry

Oh, I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight
Well, I sure hope my seams are straight
Lord, don't let my mascara run tonight

Because I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck
Got these eighteen wheels-a-rollin' until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

Oh, I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much
But when I hit those big speed bumps
My darling little rhinestone pumps
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch

But still I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Headin' down the interstate, just tryin' to make a buck
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on

I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a truck
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck
And I'm late for my appointment down at my hair salon
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Trivia==
* This marks the first time that Al has parodied father/daughter artists. He parodied Billy Ray Cyrus's &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; with &quot;[[Achy Breaky Song]].&quot;
* When Al is a worker at a fast food restaurant, the cash register reads 27.27. This is another example of 27 showing up in his songs.
* 27 is also seen at the very beginning of the video in Al's briefcase on the thermos on the left side of the man with the gun.

&lt;pre&gt;
Get your program running
Head out to the center
Terminals are waiting
For the data that you'll enter

Everybody says that you're a nerd, but
They should know that you just don't care
Got your Hewlett-Packard on your belt and
Vaseline in your hair

Like a true mommy's child
You were born, born to be mild
When your batteries die
You're always gonna cry
Born to be mild

Pencils in your pocket
Patent leather briefcase
Studying your Fortran
You got pimples on your face

Gotta do your homework
Forget about the prom dance
They think that you're a big jerk
'Cause you wear a pair of flood pants

Every day you wake up
Your oscilloscope is humming
Parties tend to break up
When they find out that you're coming
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
At first I was aghast, I was mortified
When Entertainment Weekly made me swallow my pride
They made it clear that unless I
Wrote them some lame parody
There wouldn't be
A piece on my new DVD

I tried to make.... them understand
I am an artist, you can't make me crank this stuff out on demand!
I am not your monkey boy
And you are not the boss of me
But if I have to stroke your egos
For some cheap publicity

I'll write this song... under duress
Just goes to show ya... extortion really works, I guess
You think I'd blow them off and kiss that plug goodbye?
Did you think I'd say no... 'cause I'm such a principled guy?

Oh no, not I
I will comply
Although frankly, I would rather jam a needle in my eye
Can't believe I'd sink this low
To promote my lousy show
Yeah, I'll comply
I will comply
Oy vey
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
I moved out to Langley recently
with a plain and simple dream
Wanna infiltrate some third world place
and topple their regime
Those men in black with their matching suitcases
where everything's on a need-to-know basis
Agents got that swagger
everyone's so cloak and dagger
I'm feeling nervous but I'm really kinda wishing
for an undercover mission
That's when the red alert came on the radio
and I put my earpiece on
Got my dark sunglasses on
and I had my weapon drawn

So I get my handcuffs
my cyanide pills
my classified dossier
Tapping the phones like yeah
shredding the files like yeah
I memorized all the enemy spies
I gotta neutralize today
Yeah it's a party in the CIA
Yeah it's a party in the CIA

I've done a couple of crazy things
that have almost gotten me dismissed
Like terminate some head of state
who wasn't even on my list
Burn that microfilm, buddy, will you?
I'd tell you why but then I'd have to kill you
You need a quickie confession?
We'll start a water boarding session
No hurry on that South American dictator
I'll assassinate him later
That's when he walked right in my laser sights
and my silencer was on
and my silencer was on
and another target's gone

Yeah we got our black ops all over the world
from Kazakhstan to Bombay
Paying the bribes like yeah
plugging the leaks like yeah
Interrogating the scum of the Earth
we'll break 'em by the break of day
Yeah it's a party in the CIA
Yeah it's a party in the CIA

Need a country destabilized?
Look no further, we're your guys
We've got snazzy suits and ties
and a better dental plan than the FBI's

Better put your hands up and get in the van
or else you'll get blown away
Staging a coup like yeah
brainwashing moles like yeah
We only torture the folks we don't like
you're probably gonna be OK
Yeah it's a party in the CIA
Yeah it's a party in the CIA

&lt;pre&gt;
Oh the sand keeps falling through the hourglass
And there's no way you're going to slow it down
You say we gotta treasure each moment
Who knows how long we're gonna be around

Yeah you keep on telling me life is short
And its hard to disagree with what you say
But if time is so precious why ya wasting mine
'Cause I'm always reading, always deleting
Every useless piece of garbage that you send my way

Every stupid hoax
All those corny jokes
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Well I don't need tons of cringe-inducing puns
Stop forwarding that crap to me

No it isn't okay if you brighten my day 
With some cut-and-pasted hackneyed Hallmark poetry
And I didn't request a personality test
Stop forwarding that crap to me

Ahhhh...
You're sending virus-laden bandwidth-hogging attachments 
To every single person you know
You're passing around a link to some dumb thing on YouTube
That everybody else already saw three years ago
And wacky badly Photoshopped billboards 
Were never that amusing to me
And I just can't believe you believe those urban legends
But I have high hopes 
Someone will point you toward Snopes
And debunk that crazy junk you're spewing constantly

No I don't want a bowl of Chicken Soup for the Soul
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Send more top 10 lists and I'll slash my wrists
Please stop forwarding that crap to me

Well I'm sorry i can't accept your paranoid rant
And I don't want the Neiman Marcus cookie recipe

Won't you kindly refrain 'cause it's hurting my brain
Stop forwarding... that crap to me

Like glittery hearts and unicorns 
And pictures of somebody's cat
Now tell me, in what alternate reality 
Would I care about something like that?

And by the way, your quotes from George Carlin 
Aren't really George Carlin
Mr. Rogers never fought the Viet Cong
And Bill Gates is never gonna give me somethin' for nothin'
And I really doubt some dead girl is gonna kill me 
If I don't pass her letter along

Well now I know you're wishin'
I'll sign your petition
But stop forwarding that crap to me
And I don't want to read your series 
Of conspiracy theories
Just stop forwarding that crap to me

And your two million loser friends
All have my address now, 
'Cause you never figured out the way to BCC

Now I gotta insist
Take me off of your list
Stop forwarding that crap to me
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)

(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Just stop it now
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Oh, no
(Stop forwarding that crap to me) 
Ohhh...

(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
I can't take it
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Aw, please
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)

(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
You gotta stop
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Right now
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)

(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
I'm not kidding!
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
At the risk of being slightly repetitious 
Gonna ask you now to stop! (Stop!)
Sending me that... (Crap!)
I don't want it!
Don't send it to me
Now don't send it to me!

(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Just stop! 
(Stop forwarding that crap to me)
Ohh...
Stop forwarding that crap to me
To me

Ooh yeah
Oh

I'm your shelter from the storm
You know I'll always have your back
I'll even let you warm your freezing hands
Inside my butt crack

I never get out my leaf blower when Oprah is on
And when you're telling me about your feelings
I try not to yawn
And when we're at parties I don't talk about your spastic bladder
When you're cleaning the gutters on the roof I hold the ladder

And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love
I don't know what love is

(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah)
Nananana no I guess I don't know
(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah)
Ahhhh listen now

There's a microscopic bit of milk left in the refrigerator
I could've finished it off but I quit in case you want a tiny little sip for later
And if you cut the cheese then maybe I'll wink and say the dog's to blame
And I make sure to call you baby every time I forget your name
I'll even tell you, girl, when you start looking fat
'Cause all your so-called friends will probably neglect to mention that

And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love 
I don't know what love is

(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah)
Nananana well then I don't know
(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah)
Oh no

Even though you make me sit through &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;
Well I still adore you
I'll kiss you even if you've have omelettes for breakfast
And I can't stand omelettes
After I take a bath
If its still warm I'll leave the water in there for you
I give you my word
You're so beautiful you make a glorious sunset look like a big fat turd

Yeah!

Every time I see you trying to lift some really heavy thing
You can always count on me to help by saying something encouraging
If you get drunk and pass out I never Sharpie up your face
And I don't wipe my nose on your couch even though that's a super convenient place
I totally support every idiotic thing you do
And I almost never pretend you're someone else when I'm making out with you

And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love
I don't know what love is

(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah) 
No I don't know what love is
(Nah-na-nah-nah-na-nah-na-nah) 
Well I don't know what love is
I don't know what love is

[Audible inhale]
Beautiful tats, all over my back
Makes me so proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud
I got another tattoo, baby (Yeah)
Another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
(Ha!)
No part of me's blank, I'm really ink-obsessed
It's like an art show the moment that I get undressed (Check it!)
At every job interview, they're just so impressed (Really?)
'Cause I got all my ex-wives on my chest! (Ha, ha!)

Over here is Clay Aiken, there's a side of bacon, (Huh!)
And a Minotaur pillow fightin' with Satan (Yes!)
Next to Hello Kitty and a zombie ice skatin' (Yah!)
Wait... it's Ronald Regan

I've got these dragons, (Yo!) I've got these dolphins (Yo!)
All inscribed on me indelibly (Indelibly!)
I've had bad reactions, (Yeah!) Bad infections, (Yeah!)
Even Hepatitis C ('Titis C)

My friends think that I need therapy (Therapy)
Maybe some laser surgery (Surgery)
For the flaming goat skull on my knee
(Knee) Knee (Knee) Knee
(Hey!)

Beautiful tats, (Yeah!) all over my back (All over!)
And I've got some space here on the side of my face here (Ha, ha!)
For another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)

No, I'm not high, (High) I'm really okay (Okay!)
I just love these scribbles (Ha, ha!) that won't go away (Yes)
I've got another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Yeah...

Yes, there were a few, I got from losin' a bet.
I misspelled a word or two, still there's nothin' I regret.
My shoppin' trips are no sweat, there's never stuff I forget.
Check out this rad Boba Fett. He's playin' clarinet!

Beautiful tats (Yeah!) all over my back (All over!)
And what the heck, (Ha, ha!) there's still some room on my neck (What?)
I'll get another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)

I don't know why, (Why?) but every day, (Day!)
Whenever folks see me, they just back away (Woo!)
I've got another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Another tattoo, baby ('Nuh, 'nuh, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo, babe, 'nuh, 'nother tattoo)
Yeah...

[Tattoo gun noises]
D'ow! Duh... 
Okay, right there by my elbow.
You see? Yeah. I got a couple square inches left.
Uh... maybe a squid, or a tarantula, or somethin', I don't know. Surprise me.
[Bzzzzz!]
D'ow! Mother f....

You're sort of famous,
A minor celebrity,
And so it only makes sense 
The world would be
Obsessed with every single thing
You do

They're running 'round
With their camcorders in the night,
They're lurking patiently and 
Hopin' that they just might
See something real embarrassing
You do

The bad hair day and sweat-stained T-shirt,
That's the story that they're gonna feature
With exclusive pics of your flabby behind,
You think you're all alone
But that's right when you'll find...

A bunch of paparazzi poppin' outta nowhere,
Cameras in your face
And then suddenly-y-yy
You're TMZ-e-ee
You're on TMZ

Following you when 
You're walking down the street
And askin' stupid questions 
While you're tryin' to eat
So you cover your face thinking to yourself:
&quot;Hey, isn't this creepy?&quot;

And they're out there praying
You'll have a big meltdown
And take 'em on a little
Car chase through this whole town
They'll be there with you when you're going to jail,
First on the scene for every wardrobe fail

You just picked up some transvestite,
Seconds later, it's up on the website
Get a Vegas wedding, a quickie divorce,
And they'll be sneaking in, snappin' pictures of course

And if they ever catch you pickin' your nose or
Stumblin' down the street on a drunken spree-e-ee
You're on TMZ-ee
Stalkin' you, just waiting by your front door
Trailin' you through airport security-y-yy,
They're with TMZ
They're with TMZ

(Spoken)
&quot;We caught this Oscar nominee...picking up dog poo!&quot;
&quot;Is that a baby bump?&quot;
&quot;I pronounce her guilty...of leaving the house while fat!&quot;
&quot;Look who's drinking coffee!!&quot;
&quot;Everything celebrities do is fascinating!&quot;

Oh, lemme tell ya it's
Gettin' to the point where
A famous person can't
Even get a DUI,
or go on a racist rant
Those guys are all around
So you really shouldn't dare
Goin' to every club in town
If you've lost your underwear...

Seems that every single time a star decides to
Shave their head or ram their car into a tree-e-ee,
They're on TMZ-e-ee
If they catch you peein' in the bushes,
Later on that night, well I guarantee-e-ee
You're on TMZ-e-ee
You're on TMZ

You're on TMZ
Every single celebrity-y-yy,
Knows they're gonna be-e-ee
They're on TMZ
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
He's a midnight T.V. master with skin of alabaster
He's been awesome since the 80's and handy with the ladies.
Tells his bosses were to stick it, he's Andy's meal ticket.
Doesn't follow me on Twitter. It's okay, I'm not bitter.
Gonna tell you more about him but first I'll just say.

Hey... look at me!
I'm on his show, that's right!
Only took eighteen years,
guess he's just kinda slow!

I remember this one time when Conan and I went camping
We were roasting weenies, and then some guy walks in our campsite
Conan goes completely mental and rips the stranger's face off.
Wears the face on top of his face and this stupid dance while
wearing this enormous diaper made out of baby kittens
And he does that creepy laugh that still haunts my dreams to this day.
Oh no, what have I done? He said that I'd be sorry
If I told a single soul and I just told everybody
Right here on his own T.V. show
Man, I'm in so much trouble
Tell my wife and kid I love them
I better run for my life

DON'T KILL ME, CONAN!

[Al and Band]
No hope is left of being saved
The icy sea will be our grave
Pain and death await us all
Hey! I wonder what it feels like to drown
And I was thinking...

[Captain]
Okay, okay, okay!
Perhaps you gentlemen should find a seat on the lifeboat after all.

[Al]
No no no no, we've accepted our fate
Perhaps our music can provide some…

[Captain]
Some peace, yes, I got that.
Um, do you think your could provide some peace with something 
a little less dark perhaps?

[Al]
Ah! A happy tune!
Like that new jazzamataz that's been sweeping the American south

[Captain]
Yes, exactly, some of that jazzman… is that a thing?
Whatever, that'd be fine.

[Al and Band]
How many life boats are there now? (None!)
I said how many lifeboats are there now? (None at all!)
Well, maybe there's one left maybe just one more
You have to strangle through the others and the lifeboats could be yours
Maybe there's one left
Maybe just one more
Throw my youngster overboard and the lifeboat could be yours. 
Hey!

[Captain]
Stop nodding!
Why are you nodding!?

[Al]
What's wrong?

[Captain]
What is with those lyrics!?

[Al]
Hey, I'll have you know that &quot;No Lifeboats Left&quot; is one of our biggest hits

[Captain]
You mean you've already had these written?

[Al]
Oh course!
I wrote that about the same time that I wrote.. umm..
&quot;Survival is a Statistical Impossibility&quot;

[Band Member 1]
Oh, and &quot;Deep Sea Crabs will Eat your Face&quot;

[Band Member 2]
&quot;Will Not Hesitate to Shoot You for that Life Jacket!&quot; is another favorite

[Captain]
The passengers are terrified

[Al]
As they should be!
After all…
There lungs will soon be filled with grimy water
and probably some fecal matter
from the terrified swimmers in the sea who pooped their pants

[Captain]
Don't tell me that's one of your biggest hits too…

[Al]
No, actually we're just kinda riffing that.
Let's do it again louder!

[Captain]
Gentlemen, gentleman!
The ship is going down.
These passengers need something to give them courage,
not morbid dooms about lobsters eating our bodies

[Al]
The captain is right.
Let's play a tune that will fill this entire deck 
with the same strength and resolve that he has shown.

[Al and Band]
Don't fear the sea, but think instead
Of our brave captain who welcomes death
When that iceberg first appeared
He did not turn, he did not steer
A lot of people warned him about
Taking his ship out without enough lifeboats
But apparently, he would not be scared away
Oh, he's so brave, our captain's brave
Yes, he's so brave, he's sunk our ship!
&lt;/pre&gt;

I, I got a new girl

You would really recognize her

I'm so happy

Why would a person like her care for you?




Why, Why does she bother

When you're not the one for her?

Ooooooo

So I stole her




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl

We all want things

But happy is not what it brings




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl

No girl's going to come to you

And bring you to the place where you want to be

But where do you want to be?




In my Room

For so many years

I’ve wondered how

How can a person like you bring her joy?




In my Room

Where I think of my Plans

Ooooooo

And so I took her




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl

We all want things

But happy is not what it brings




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl

No girl's going to come to you

And bring you to the place where you want to be

But where do you want to be?




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

And she is happy now

With Me rather than You

She’s left you all alone




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl

No girl's going to come to you

And bring you to the place where you want to be




I Stole your Girl

I Stole your Girl

(I Stole your Girl)

I Stole your Girl

I Stole your Girl

I Stole your Girl

I Stole your Girl




I Stole your Girl

And it made me really happy

I Stole your Girl



What did you think? Should I improve it? Let me know in the comments below.

'''The Presidents of the United States''', or &quot;PUSA,&quot;  are an American alternative rock band. They have many connections with Al. In 1996, Al parodied their song [[Wikipedia:Lump (song)|Lump]], and made [[Gump]]. In 2008, Al directed the music video for their song [[Mixed Up S.O.B.]]. That same year, Al performed the song 
&quot;{{W|More Than a Feeling}}&quot; by [[Wikipedia:Boston (band)|Boston]] with PUSA [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD8nQDAiecE live in concert].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="492">It looks to me in some scenes of the video that Al is wearing some of the costumes himself. The close ups (Frankenstein's monster, Avatar, the weird mad hatter, the peacock), as well as one or two of the outfits, like the gold straightjacket and the outfit on the catwalk at the start, but maybe I am being decieved visually with those ones! Can anyone shed any light on this? He is very pretty in make up too!

That's right, the program is over.
So now you talk trash about it in a bitter rage.
On your Twitter and Facebook page.
Won't you join us again next week?
At 30 Rockefeller Plaza, NYC
Where the ratings are (awesome)
Remarkably somehow we're still on the air.
We'll just keep doing this whether
You like it or not.
We really do love our fans, yes both of you!

&lt;pre&gt;
I don't care about your karma
I don't care about what's hip
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do

I won't swim in your Jacuzzi
You can't make me settle down
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch
And scream until I'm blue

I may as well be hyper
As long as I'm still around
'Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back
When I'm six feet under ground

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead 
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

When are you
Cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your head

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I can't stand the smell of incense
I don't really like to jog
No Joni Mitchell eight-tracks in my car (ooh)

I hate anything organic
Even health food makes me sick
You won't catch me sipping Perrier
Down in some sushi bar

I tell you, now's the time to go for
All the gusto you can grab
You'll have plenty of time to be low key
When you're laid out on the slab

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

When are you
Cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your head

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

Ow!

I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans
No redwood hot tub to my name

I got all that I want
And if it's all the same to you
I don't need a course in self-awareness
To find out who I am

And I'd rather have a
a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan

So don't ask me what I'm into
I don't need to prove I'm cool
I'll break your arm
If you ask me what's my sign

I won't tell you where my head's at
I don't need to see no shrink
Psychosis may be in this year
But I'm really not that kind

And I'm in no hurry to be casual
In fact I think I'll wait
Until I'm pushing up the daisies
(Like, wow, man, can you relate)

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

Cheerios, apple jacks, cheerios
Did you know frootloops fit in your nose
I may be just a simple guy
But just the thought of corn flakes makes me high
Cheerios, cocoa puffs, cheerios
Makes me want to take off all my clothes
I love them dearly, and that's how it goes
Cheerios, apple jacks, cheerios

Wearin' old T-shirts and grubby jeans
People say I look kinda odd
Well, I'm never accepted in the social set
'Cause they say that I'm a clod

But once in a while, I go to my closet
And I put on something mod
And when I step out in my leisure suit
People stand up and applaud

Leisure suit serenade
Slip one on and you got it made
You better hope and pray that the colors don't fade
That's the leisure suit serenade

Now, it don't matter if the collar's bent
If it's got nylon twenty percent
Now I'm as cool as the ASB president
Leisure suit serenade

Leisure suit serenade
Slip one on and you got it made
You better hope and pray that the colors don't fade
That's the leisure suit serenade, oh yeah
That's the leisure suit serenade

&lt;pre&gt;
Now, you won't find me braggin'
'Bout my big green station wagon
Or tellin' 'bout the traffic laws I'm breakin'
Everybody knows that I wouldn't dare
Match my wits with a red Corvair
And just the thought of a Pinto leaves me shakin'

Now, I don't think that I could hack
Drivin' a big white Cadillac
With ripped up upholstery and unnecessary frills
No, I don't think that I could bear
Drivin' somethin' other than a Belvedere
In a Belvedere I can really get my thrills

Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
Just watch me pass that Porsche on the right
I can take you anywhere
In my 1964 Belvedere
Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight

I don't think that I could cruise
In one of those small VW's
Or zip along the highway in a classy pickup truck
There's somethin' 'bout a Comet
That makes me wanna vomit
And those Datsuns just ain't worth a Fudgesicle, no

Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
You got nothin' to lose but your life
It can take away your blues
All you've gotta do is cruise
In my big black Plymouth Belvedere tonight

With red upholstery
Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight, yes indeed
Woo, goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
Yeah, goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
It was just the other day
When we went to Joe's Cafe
Just to order up a couple steaks to eat

But we noticed something wrong
All the Worcestershire was gone
But the waitress brought a different kind of treat

She said this sauce was the chef's new creation
Guaranteed, it's the real taste sensation
But she warned us it's made out of prunes
&quot;Try a little if you dare&quot;
&quot;Nothing can compare&quot;
So we had some and now we swear
We won't eat prunes again

That was such a dirty trick
Boy, it really made us sick
Well it looks like we've been done in by the prune

Still the memory lingers on
I been livin' in the john
'Cause I've had the runs since Monday afternoon

This said this sauce was the chef's new creation
Guaranteed, it's the latest sensation
But she warned us it's made out of prunes
&quot;Try a little if you dare&quot;
&quot;Nothing can compare&quot;
So we had some and now we swear
We won't eat prunes again

Won't eat prunes again
No no

Yeah!

Eat the new sauce
Same as the old sauce 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Oh, I've really got those ozone layer blues
From my elbow down to my shoes
So let's throw another fire on the logs

Now we can go downtown and fill the latrine
With genuine Columbian lima beans
Dynastic and elastic, it's all made out of plastic
There's nobody here but us frogs

I'd like to find a girl who really cares
About the size of my nasal hairs
She could feed bananas to the dogs

We could climb the church and look down from the steeple
Where all the ants look like people
Nutritious and delicious, it's even surreptitious
There's nobody here but us frogs

They say I'm crazy
But I couldn't care less
Why don't they leave me alone
Can't they see that I'm happy to be a psychiatrical mess

I get a thrill
Bein' mentally ill, yes I do
They seem to think it's a crime
But it's a pleasure sublime, oh yes

That's why I'm happy here inside these padded walls
Makin' obscene telephone calls
And throwin' TV dinners to the hogs

I never trust a naked Eskimo
And don't you eat that purple snow
Revolting and disgusting
My belly button's rusting
There's nobody here but us frogs

They say I'm crazy
But I couldn't care less
Why don't they leave me alone
Can't they see that I'm happy to be a psychiatrical mess

I get a thrill
Bein' mentally ill, yes I do
They seem to think it's a crime
But it's a pleasure sublime, oh yes

That's why I'm happy here inside these padded walls
Makin' obscene telephone calls
And throwin' TV dinners to the hogs
I like to eat my ice cubes boiling hot
And Wilshire Boulevard's a Commie plot

Amazingly congruent, and commonly affluent
Innately effervescent, surprisingly incessant
Superblier commended, eccentric and demented
There's nobody here but us
Nobody here but us
Nobody here but us frogs, I mean it
Nobody here but us frogs

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
They tell us that we lost our tails
Evolving up from little snails
I say it's all just wind and sails
Are we not men? We are Devo
Are we not men? D-E-V-O

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

Don't turn around, uh-oh
(He says) Der Kommissar's in town, uh-oh

(I'm a man) I'm a woman
(I'm a man) I'm a slut
(I'm a man) I'm a one night stand
 I'm a pig (I'm a man)
(I'm a man) I'm your mother
(I'm a man) I'm a little girl when we make love together

Hey, hey, hey!
Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better, better, better, better, better, better, yeah

L.A. woman
You're my woman
Got my mojo risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Hey!

In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Hey, Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Hey, Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Gonna shoot my old lady
Caught her messin' 'round with another man

I said two thousand zero zero party over
Oops, out of time
So tonight we're gonna yodel like it's 1999 

Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay he-hoo
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay he-hoo

Bad boys get spanked, huh!

I'm hot blooded, check it and see
Got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on, baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watchin' you

She blinded me with sceince
She blinded me- with science!
She blinded me

There's a lady who knows all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying
a stairway
to heaven!

Hey!

&lt;pre&gt;
I remember all the moments when I used to hold you near,
I remember the sweet nothings you would whisper in my ear,
Whenever we would hold my hand my heart would skip a beat,
We were such a happy couple and my life was so complete,
But times have changed and now you've left me for some other guy,
It seems I'll never get you back no matter how I try,
This emptiness inside of me is tearing me apart,
I gotta find a way that I can soothe this aching heart

'Cause babe I get so lonely whenever you're not here,
You never even call me on the phone,
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer,
And have a little orgy on my own

I can't believe you'd ever go and leave me for that chump,
So what if he's a millionaire, and I work in a dump?
So what if he makes more in an hour, than I make in a day?
He lights his pipes with dollar bills and bathes in Perrier,
Well I'm not much into culture, and I don't drive no fancy cars,
And I couldn't tell a dirt clod from a plate of caviar,
I'd like to meet this friend of yours, so bring him by my place,
I'll have a friendly chat with him and stab him in the face

'Cause you know I get so lonely whenever you're not here,
You never even call me on the phone,
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer,
And have a little orgy on my own

I can't forget the day you put my love back on the shelf,
It was then I knew I had to get a firm grip on myself,
For other folks this solitude would be a living Hell,
But when times get rough I still can handle myself pretty well,
It's hard on me remembering the way that we were then,
But when I read my magazines, I feel myself again
I must admit, from time to time, my memory still lingers,
But the only pain I feel is from the blisters on my fingers

Babe you know I get so lonely whenever you're not here
You never even call me on the phone,
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer,
And have a little orgy on my own

Yes I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer
And have a little orgy,
Have a little orgy,
I'll have a little orgy on my own
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Welcome==
My userboxes are under my infobox.

Awesome note: I think that tweet I made poll was meant to be [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5dHGu4WzCQ this...]
I'm a new contributor who the awesome [[User:The thing|the thing]] promoted to sysop. I'm only rediscovering Al, and never had an album before I rediscovered him. 

==Collection==
===2013===
#{{Al|The Essential &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic}}
#{{Al|Alpocalypse}} (Deluxe CD + DVD edition)
#{{Al|Poodle Hat}}
#{{Al|&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic}}
#{{Al|In 3-D}}
#{{Al|Dare To Be Stupid}}
#{{Al|Polka Party!}}
#{{Al|Even Worse}}
===Awaiting...===

Signed,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8643">{{documentation subpage}}

This template is intended to be a [[wikt:metatemplate|metatemplate]] for sidebar templates, which are [[Vertical direction|vertically]]-aligned [[Wikipedia:Navigation templates|navigation templates]].  The sidebar is usually positioned on the right-hand side of a page, in the same way as the {{tlx|infobox}} template is aligned for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|infoboxes]]. 

{{tl|Sidebar with collapsible lists}} adds collapsibility to a sidebar's sections, i.e., the means to show or hide sections by clicking links beside their headings.

== Usage ==
{{Sidebar
| name = {{PAGENAME}}
| outertitle = {{{outertitle}}}
| topimage = {{{topimage}}}
| topcaption = {{{topcaption}}}
| pretitle = {{{pretitle}}}
| title = {{{title}}}
| image = {{{image}}}
| above = {{{above}}}
| heading1 = {{{heading1}}}
| content1 = {{{content1}}}
| heading2 = {{{heading2}}}
| content2 = {{{content2}}}
| heading3 = {{{heading3}}}
| content3 = {{{content3}}}
| content4 = ... up to 35th ...
| heading35 = {{{heading35}}}
| content35 = {{{content35}}}
| below = {{{below}}}
}}

      <comment>Created page with &quot;{{documentation subpage}} &lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;  This is the {{tl|high-risk}} message box. It is meant to be put at the top ...&quot;</comment>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|high-risk}} message box. It is meant to be put at the top of the documentation page on the most high-use (high-risk) templates, i.e., for templates used on 100,000 pages or more. For templates used on 2,000–100,000 pages, it is recommended to use the {{tl|high-use}} template instead, which has a softer wording.

'''''Note:''''' It is normal that some of the links in the message box are red. 

=== Usage ===
The template can be used as is. But it can also take some parameters: 
* First parameter is the number of pages. See [[Wikipedia:Database reports/Templates with the most transclusions]] to find out how many pages use a given template.
* Second parameter is the name of some other talk page if you want discussion to be made there instead. But a better option might be to redirect the talkpage of your template to that other talkpage.

===Examples===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{high-risk| 300,000+ | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{high-risk| 300,000+ | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

&lt;pre&gt;
{{high-risk| 300,000+ }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{high-risk| 300,000+ }}

&lt;pre&gt;
{{high-risk| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{high-risk| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

The full code for a /doc page top can look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{documentation subpage}}
{{high-risk| 300,000+ }}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
The [[/sandbox]] and [[/testcases]] links are the standard names for such subpages. If those pages are created then the green /doc box for the template will detect them and link to them in its heading. For instance see the top of this documentation.

=== See also ===
* {{tl|high-risk}} – For the most high-use (high-risk) templates.
* {{tl|high-use}} – For the slightly less high-risk templates.
* {{tl|intricate template}} – For the intricate, i.e., complex templates.
* {{tl|pp-template}} – The protection template that usually is put on high-risk templates.
* {{tl|used in system}} – For templates used in the Wikipedia user interface.

__NOTOC__

The '''template link''' template is a simple [[w:Macro (computer science)|macro]] [[m:Help:template|template]] used to display a template name as a link surrounded by braces, thus showing how the template name would be used in code. Its primary use is in instruction and documentation. A short example is that the code:

::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Tl|Example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:generates

::{{Tl|Example}}

More complex variations are described below.

===Example===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code
! Result
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Tl|Void}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{[[Template:Void|Void]]}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Tl2|X1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[{{{LANG|}}}{{{SISTER|}}}{{ns:Template}}:X1|X1]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Tl2|SISTER=M:|3x}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[{{{LANG|}}}M:{{ns:Template}}:3x|3x]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Tl2|SISTER=wikibooks|LANG=de:|WP}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

== Usage ==
This template is for giving examples of [[Wikipedia:Template messages|template]] parameter source code (useful in template documentation and talk page discussions of template code).  It must have one or two parameters itself. The first is the name of the example parameter to display (this may be ''empty'', but it '''must''' be ''present''), and the second (optional) one is a value for the first example parameter, or (if the first {{tlx|para}} parameter is empty) an unnamed example parameter.

===Examples===
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|name}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|name}}
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|title|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;book title&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|title|&lt;var&gt;book title&lt;/var&gt;}}
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|3=section|2=&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para||section}}
#:(for unnamed parameters in the example code; note the empty first parameter in the {{tlx|para}} template)
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;parameter&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;value&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|&lt;var&gt;parameter&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;}}

When using literal, pre-specified values, simply provide the value (appearance as in example 3). When illustrating hypothetical, variable or user-definable values, use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (appearance as in example 2), and the same should be done for non-literal, example parameters (as in example 4).

Album: '''Unknown'''

Released: '''Possibly 2014'''

Recorded: '''2013-?'''

Total running time: '''Unknown'''


==Tracks==
Unknown

==Credits==
* '''[[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]''' - vocals, writing
* '''[[Steve Jay]]''' - guitar, vocals
* '''[[Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz]]''' - drums, vocals
* '''[[Rubén Valtierra]]''' - keyboard, vocals
* '''[[Jim West]]''' - guitar, vocals
* '''Amanda Palmer''' - vocals

==Trivia==
* All six original songs have been recorded.
* In an interview at the West Houston Community Center on June 24, 2013, Yankovic says that his new album is half done, that he hasn't started on the parodies yet, and that it may come out in 2014 (he has to wait for all the planets to align correctly). [http://youtu.be/0XFv3qFxeXQ]
* The album will contain 2 long songs. One will be very long, such as [[Albuquerque]], and one sort of long, such as [[Stop Forwarding That Crap To Me]].
* Bermuda will be playing [http://www.bermudaschwartz.com/images/rwbkit.jpg this drum set] on the album. Appearntly there is a clue in the picture to what the song's about. Some believe it's a {{W|Blue Öyster Cult}} style parody due to the cowbell.
* Al has stated that this will probably be his last physical album, instead focusing on releasing songs/albums online, enabling him to be more timely and topical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="449">Just a quick post.

I am updating all of the album and single pages so they all have the same section and I will be adding more sections. I am making info boxes and chronology boxes on the bottom. I decided to make the studio album colour golden rod. I will decide the colours for the other ones later.

&lt;pre&gt;
The Shark is not a friendly fish
That fact it's always proving
It seems this creatures' favorite dish is
Anything that's moving
He'll chew your face off in a flash
Or cheat you if you let him
So never loan him any cash
And be careful when you pet him
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some think the Cockroach is a pest
But that's the insect I like best
I love the way they run in fright
When I turn on the kitchen light
And when I squish them on the ground
They make a pleasant crunching sound

The life of the Vulture is one long sick joke
He hangs around waiting for something to croak
And then picks the carcass right down to the bone
Reminds me of one or two lawyers I've known

The Poodle's a slimy carnivorous beast
In pastures you might find it grazing
It's fangs measure 23-inches, at least
It's antlers are simply amazing
Sometimes it will bury its head in the sand
It's our main source of pork, ham and bacon
But, then again, on the other hand
I could be completely mistaken
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's getting late, so I suppose
We should be drawing to a close
Besides, my voice is sounding hoarse
And even my rhymes are getting worse
Poor Wendy's feeling in the dumps
She's worn her fingers down to stumps
And so, farewell, this record's through
Now go find something else to do

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="818">Paul  the Revolt is brewing, and Americans are waknig up to the Hope &amp; Change they thought they were getting  but didnt bargain for Socialism, Facism, or Progressive-ism   We need to keep the momentum rolling and vote out all those Liberals out of Congress in 2010 &amp; 2012..  Tea Parties are getting more and more attention, so much that the White House cannot say they are Unaware of soon   The Recess Rallys are getting more media attention, so the White House has been put on Notice that Americans are Mad as Hell, and were not going to take it anymore   Were not those Manufactured, Astroturf Citizens either, were real people with real concerns!  Those Congressmen that vote for this out-of-control healthcare bill WILL be voted out .. We cant keep printing &amp; spending money that we dont have  like drunken sailors</text>

&lt;pre&gt;
The first steak I ordered,
It wasn't very hot.
I had to send it back,
Let 'em have one more shot.
But the second steak I ordered,
Well it was lousy too.
Now I really hate to say it,
But there's one thing that you gotta do.
Make me steak number three, yeah.
Make me steak number three.
Make me steak number three, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Make me steak number three.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hey! Oooh! Oh!
One rule you all should obey:
Eat from the four basic food groups everyday.
Have bread, and vegetables too,
Some dairy products, but whatever you do
Don't you forget about meat.
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
Don't you forget about meat.
&lt;/pre&gt;
